# Maturity Model for Microsoft 365 - Employee Experience Competency

[!INCLUDE [content-disclaimer](includes/content-disclaimer.md)]

![Maturity Model for Microsoft 365](media/maturity-model-for-microsoft-365/M365MM.png)

## Principles of Employee Experience  

Effective organizations need to have clear and effective strategies supported by ‘on the ground’ activities, combined with positive employee experiences and alignment.  

While this competency is titled Employee Experience, we recognize that employee engagement is a related concept, and these are often used interchangeably. While they are related, they refer to different aspects of the employee-employer relationship:

- **Employee Engagement** is the commitment team members feel to their organization, its central mission, and core values. It is about the overarching connection or relationship employees have with the organization as a whole. Employee engagement typically focuses on factors such as enablement, energy, empowerment, and encouragement.

- **Employee Experience** is about individual moments and interactions that employees have with their work environment. It encompasses the input from an organization, including what employees feel, see, and hear in their daily work lives. Employee experience is influenced by various factors such as physical workspace, technology, work-life balance, and organizational culture.

While employee engagement focuses on the commitment and connection employees have with the organization, employee experience encompasses the broader aspects of an employee's interactions and experiences within the workplace. For the purposes of this competency, we will treat Engagement as a component of the overall experience.  

"Ultimately, it’s about a workplace approach that ensures employees are committed to their company goals and values, motivated to contribute to success and able to enhance their own sense of wellbeing."

The Employee Experience is the journey an employee takes with your organization. It includes every interaction that happens during the employee life cycle, plus the experiences that involve an employee's role, workspace, manager and wellbeing. It is the way the people in an organization perceive the way they are treated, enabled, and supported by their organization and how they interact with the physical workspace, culture, technology, processes, and other touch points. It often pivots around a shared sense of purpose and about removing sources of stress and friction.

![Employee Experience Lifecycle Diagram](media/microsoft365-maturity-model--employee-experience/EE%20employee%20lifecycle%20diagram.png)

There are good reasons for organizations to focus on Employee Experience. Positive experiences are associated with better productivity, lower absenteeism, higher quality, and better internal and external relationships. It results in better staff retention, faster and better recruitment, more rapid onboarding of new employees and creates positive feedback into the organizational culture.  

Traditionally, technology has had little purposeful impact on Employee Experience (other than sometimes causing stress and friction) beyond communication. However, cloud technologies and productivity platforms have now emerged with the ability to contribute to positive Employee Experience, provide mature insights and metrics, enable new forms of connection and support strategic purpose and personal growth.  occurs that it directly impacts and informs organizational Employee Experience and Engagement. This competency considers the broad principles of Employee Experience and the characteristics at the 5 levels of maturity.

## Scope of this competency

The Employee Experience competency considers what approaches and tools organizations must create an effective working environment, translating leadership intent and business needs into employee alignment and performance. This strongly interacts with organizational culture and the experience employees have throughout their employment.

This extends to strategy, leadership, vision, objectives, tracked performance measures, communication and culture management.

Employee Experience can include:

- Wellbeing
- Diversity, equality, inclusion & belonging.
- Standards, values & culture  
- Organizational, technical and personal support  
- Accessibility
- Equipment quality, availability and provisioning
- Safety, Environment, Comfort, Facilities
- Performance management and career progression
- Celebration of success
- 360° communication
- Cross-team interaction
- Training and performance management
- Team days and social activities  
...and many other elements

It is useful to categorize Employee Experience into 4 sub-competencies:  

- Connection
- Insight
- Growth
- Purpose

![Employee Experience Sub-Competency Diagram](media/microsoft365-maturity-model--employee-experience/EE%20sub-competency%20diagram.png)

## Evolution of this competency

### Level 100 - Initial

This is the starting level for a new or dysfunctional organization. Strategy may appear to be absent; plans lack consistency or conviction and staff and leadership operate with a sense of unease or evident chaos characterized by firefighting and tension.

**[Initial level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-100---initial)** characteristics include:

#### Connection (100)

- User experience is not considered.
- Organizational communication is sporadic, single-channeled and not repeated.
- There is little sense of camaraderie.
- Staff do not feel supported or valued. Many feel excluded or marginalized.
- Personal feedback focuses on the issues; praise is rarely or sincerely - given.
- Equipment, processes, line management and progression tend to feel rushed, ad hoc and changeable.

#### Insight (100)

- Staff express feelings of fear, confusion, extreme frustration or disenchantment; there is limited team cohesion.
- There are no mechanisms to provide feedback to management, nor do management seek this.
- The organization lacks any knowledge of employee satisfaction, engagement or pain points.
- Line-reporting or top-down/organization-wide, communication and direction are sporadic, ad hoc and inconsistent.
- Employee analytics are not captured or used.

#### Growth (100)

- There are limited examples of innovation.
- There is little or no training of either staff or managers.
- Processes and objectives for improving skills, competence and knowledge are absent; up-skilling by motivated staff is not recognized or rewarded.
- There is no attempt to capture, curate and share individual or organization knowledge and know-how.
- Employees are not encouraged to request training or to seek new challenges.
- Knowledge and best practice are not actively shared. Some staff are highly protective of their own knowledge and do not willingly share it with others.
- 'Water-cooler' meetings for informal knowledge exchange and peer to peer are seen as a distraction of non-productive time and are discouraged.

#### Purpose (100)

- Staff are unclear about their purpose and end goals. They do not know what is expected of them or what ‘good’ looks like.
No clear vision or mission has been formulated or communicated. Leadership may have tacit clarity; this is not understood by staff.
- Culture is not considered and is purely an emergent property of the company.
- Staff do not have a sense of what company standards of behavior, appearance and working practices should be. Unprofessional and even unacceptable behavior is not acted on by management.
- Objectives are not formalized.
- Management seems to have conflicting priorities and there is often interdepartmental ‘gamesmanship’ and rivalries.
- Day-to-day activities are highly task driven, requiring extensive supervision and micro-management.
- Business and personal objectives are either absent or applied in ad hoc, changeable and ephemeral ways.
- The business lacks focus & fails to prioritize, or changes focus too rapidly to be effective. Alternatively, activities may be too rigidly enforced, preventing adaptation.
- Little is done to create a positive working environment, to accommodate physical, emotional or well-being needs.  
- Accessibility needs are not considered; this includes a lack of provision for dyslexia, visual or physical impairment or other physiological needs. Even things like access to beverages, toilets, light, warmth and fresh air are variable or not actively considered. There may be safety implications. No one seems to be responsible or accountable for these.
- Workstations, cubicles, and desk spaces are inconsistent and inefficient or inappropriate. Equipment and tools are frequently defective, and no one actively resolves this.

#### Impacts 100

Organizations at this level often have high proportions of disengaged and unsatisfied staff, whether this is outwardly apparent or not. Staff turnover is high, productivity is poor and there are frequent HR issues to manage. Staff leaving the business is a constant drain on its capabilities.

A high proportion of management time is spent dealing with disengagement rather than growth.

Toxic personalities and individuals are not addressed, leading to staff disengagement, absence and exits.

There is often high absenteeism.

### Level 200 - Managed

There are efforts to ensure that the company strategy is trickled down to staff. The strategy may lack clarity or resonance with employees, or may not be translated into actions they feel they can engage in. There is a sense of 'in this together' but it is characterized by fighting against the issues rather than pulling towards the goals. Managers have an understanding that staff should have good experiences and gel as a team but are unclear how to achieve this.

**[Managed level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-200---managed)** characteristics include:

#### Connection (200)

- There are attempts at informing, including and inspiring staff through briefings and email communication. These tend to be one way. Absent staff hear about what was said second hand and from a variety of sources.  
- Organizational news tends to be published on the website but not internally.
- ✨ Team members tend to support each other, often in the face of adversity. They socialize, share insights and develop friendships.
- 'Bad actors' often cause frustration and discontent; active intervention to address this is sporadic.
- The needs of some staff are not adequately addressed and there are observable biases and discrimination.
- Staff lack trust in leadership, other teams and some colleagues. There are no established tools or processes to allow multiway dialog between colleagues or between staff and leadership, to share and build on ideas or establish communities of interest and expertise.
- There are processes for providing equipment and other work tools, but these do not always feel fair or effective, favoring seniority rather than need.

#### Insight (200)

- A minority of staff say they are actively engaged in surveys.
- Staff sometimes feel uncertain, frustrated or excluded, often because they do not know why decisions, especially about them and their roles, have been made.  
- There are occasional attempts to gather staff feedback about employee satisfaction, engagement and possible improvements via surveys and a suggestion box. Many managers solicit feedback and insights from staff, but co-ordination with other managers is limited and ad hoc. There is a lack of consistency in this and in the ability or commitment to act on it.
- ✨ Managers are encouraged to adopt effective line-management approaches, one-to-one and regular team meetings. Active encouragement and mentoring may be included in these.
- Staff and managers are concerned for the well-being of their staff, but often lack the knowledge of how best to intervene.
- ✨ Some managers consider employee workload, activities and team composition. Some experiment with skills & capability assessment and team profiles & dynamics.

#### Growth (200)

- Training is unstructured, inconsistent, and largely left to line managers.  
- Managers are rarely trained to be effective supervisors and leaders; they are expected to learn on the job.
- Employees are tacitly expected to take the lead when they are ready to develop new skills or for new challenges and then approach their managers for training, secondment, promotion etc.
- There are some attempts in some teams to share knowledge and best practice. There is little to drive adoption of this and most attempts fall into disuse or have limited impact.
- Individual objectives prioritize business needs, not personal development.
- Staff are expected to learn on the job without having access to specific learning resources. Many staff willingly give their time, but this impacts their own productivity without this necessarily being recognized by their line-management.
- ✨ Some individuals may be picked out for mentorships and development.
- Some communities of interest emerge spontaneously, largely with organizational support.
- 'Water-cooler' meetings for informal knowledge exchange and peer to peer learning do occur but are seen as eating into work time in many cases.  

#### Purpose (200)

- ✨ Management is conscious of culture and attempt to articulate it. There is some attempt to create coherent values or principles in the business.
- The organization publishes some form of strategy, vision and/or mission, but this tends to be confused, unapproachable, idealistic or appear unrealistic and unachievable.
- Objectives are mostly in place, but may not be consistent, tracked or linked to organizational needs.
- ✨ There are 1-to-1 sessions between managers and staff, though these may be sporadic, lack structure and lack clarity on the purpose of the meetings.
- Equipment and tools that are not fit for purpose or are faulty are slow to be replaced or repaired.
- ✨ Managers and colleagues do what they can to address failures in behavior and professional standards; though they are not exactly clear what the organization’s standards are, relying on their personal values.

#### Impacts 200

Staff, and customers, rarely are negative about the organization, though there is still a need to manage negative impressions that impact recruitment and customer relationships.

Staff may attempt to make proactive improvements, though these initiatives often use up valuable resource and staff energy without achieving their goals.

Collaboration and peer support begins to improve productivity, though lacks consistency and remains fragile.  

The organization begins to recognize that positive impacts are related to the changes they are making.  

### Level 300 - Defined

The organization understands the key drivers of Employee Experience.

**[Defined level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-300---defined)** characteristics include:

#### Connection (300)

- ✨ Tools are in place, including an intranet and other portals which act as hubs or gateways to news, communication, information and connection between staff. This is consistent, regular but not personalized and not always up-to-date. Some members of the leadership team provide updates in the form of blogs or other reflections and staff are enabled to add comments to these.
- There are useful tools and processes to allow multi-way dialog between colleagues or between staff and leadership, to share and build on ideas. There are active communities of interest and expertise.
- ✨ Staff briefings are captured and can be accessed, sometimes in video form, after the initial briefing. Questions can be raised by staff after the briefings and communications.  
- ✨ The structure of the company is published and maintained. Staff are encouraged to update their profiles, with interests and skill areas as well as such personal information as they are comfortable with, and to engage in communities of interest.
- ✨ The need for inclusiveness is recognized and this is reflected in attempts to ensure accessibility standards are met, that day to day work related needs can be catered for; there isn’t an assumption that 'one size fits all'.
- A collaborative work environment is encouraged that promotes teamwork, cross-functional collaboration. Competitive or ‘us and them’ behavior is frowned upon.
- ✨ There is a palpable sense of belonging and pride in the organization. There are mechanisms for identifying and reporting disruptive behaviors.  
- The organization recognizes that experience doesn’t end when they leave, and the act of leaving is treated as a positive for all involved.
- ✨ The organization understands its values and expected behaviors; it attempts to recruit and develop staff based on these; policies and standards support them.
- ✨ There are frequent, purposeful 1-to-1 sessions between managers and staff. There is some involvement of staff in decision making.
- The importance of recognizing and appreciating employees’ efforts is tacitly and visibly acted upon. There may be reward programs, employee of the month or other forms of recognition, though these are not consistent or analyzed across functions. There are active attempts to avoid exclusion and to eliminate all forms of discrimination. Staff feel fairly treated.
- ✨ Processes for providing equipment and other work tools are regarded as reasonably fair and appropriate. They operate in a timely fashion to provide people get what they need with little delay.
- Staff trust their leadership for the most part, though aren’t always clear about why certain decisions are made.

### Insight (300)

- Staff generally feel informed about organization decisions and can discuss changes to their roles and teams. Staff have opportunities to receive support and clarity when they feel uncertain, frustrated or excluded.
- Staff absences and sickness, staff turnover and other metrics are monitored; both line-management and HR act on this via a consistent process.  
- ✨ Managers use feedback and insights from staff and discuss their observations and seek advice from their peers as well as with HR. This includes staff performance and well-being and related ‘soft’ measures.
- There are a range of tools, including workplace analytics, staff profile models (DiSC, Myers-Briggs etc.) that are used, though these tend to be driven by intermittent initiatives and may not be consistently applied.  
- Staff skills & capability are assessed and fed into learning and growth activities.
- ✨ Individuals also have access to tools and workplace analytics to enable them to make decisions about their approaches, balance or priorities.  
- ✨ Staff are allowed to take breaks, reserve focus time and decline meetings when needed and appropriate.  

#### Growth (300)

- There are policies and programs for staff skills development and staff records that capture this.
- Key staff have regular training appropriate to their roles and development. Not everyone accesses this or understands the benefits.
- Line managers are expected to improve their management & leadership abilities.
- ✨ Employees have opportunities to play to personal strengths, to be successful, to grow, develop new skills and take on new challenges.
- ✨ There are attempts at disseminating knowledge, best practice and experience, though these are only partly systematized.
- Learning and growth begin to appear in individual objectives, mostly at the instigation of individuals and managers.
- There are attempts to make it easy for staff to learn on the job and easily find the knowledge, resources and expertise they need on demand.
- There are some programs to introduce individual and organizational growth through networking, mentorships, and communities.
- ✨ Stories are increasingly used to communicate knowledge and to establish culture and values.
- Interactive Frequently Asked Question tools allow open requests for knowledge and provide timely responses.  
- ✨ 'Water-cooler' meetings, 'non-purposeful' get-togethers and 'fika' breaks encourage knowledge exchange and peer to peer learning.

#### Purpose (300)

- Staff understand and value the organization’s vision and principles, as well as accountability.
- There are opportunities to contribute to Vision.
- ✨ There are well-established company standards and staff are expected to adhere to them.
- ✨ Equipment and workplace are of good quality and maintained in reasonable condition. Faults are rectified when notified.  
- Personal SMART objectives are consistently in place. They are tracked via line management but are only tenuously linked to organizational needs and are not integrated across teams.
- The importance of ‘First Impressions count’ is recognized and attempts are made to provide a positive pre-employee experience as well as a welcoming and organized onboarding process to set the tone for new hires’ journey with the organization.  
- ✨ Health and well-being are considered alongside productivity and objectives.

#### Impacts 300

Staff, and customers, are advocates for the organization, leading to improved recruitment.

Staff take initiative, and they are proactive, including taking responsibility for their own development. They hold themselves accountable for delivering on their promises. They work collaboratively and synergistically with other team members.  

The organization begins to see positive impacts on areas like profitability, productivity, efficiency, quality, creativity, safety, compliance, employee well-being, and staff retention.  

### Level 400 - Predictable

Employee Experience is a core activity for the organization, with executive accountability and metrics that demonstrate the impact on the organization and support its progress.

## Cost and Benefit

![Employee Experience Benefits](media/microsoft365-maturity-model--employee-experience/EE%20benefits%20diagram.png)

Microsoft Work Trend Index also reports that:

- 89% of employees who feel that their companies use feedback to drive change report being engaged at work.
- Engaged employees report 1/3 of the burnout rates.
- Companies with engaged employees had doubled the stock price.

The [Microsoft Work Trend Index](https://www.microsoft.com/worklab/work-trend-index/) has further insights.  

## Conclusion

It is vitally important that organizations get their Employee Experience right. The challenge is that it requires a broad and deep approach which takes time, effort and commitment to achieve. However even modest changes up the maturity scale make a difference.

It’s unlikely that an organization can excel in every characteristic across all 4 sub-competencies, but eliminating level 100 and 200 characteristics everywhere in the organization is a great place to start, before maturing further in priority teams, especially those with high staff turnover or which have customer facing roles.

Use of technologies can help, but these must always be blended with good management, leadership and people skills and culture.
