# The Microsoft 365 Maturity Model - Introduction

## Overview

We often hear from people in the community that they know they aren't using Microsoft 365 capabilities as fully or as efficiently as they would like. Sometimes this can be an existential dread rather than a specific set of clear ideas about what is missing or what to do to work smarter.

Taking a holistic view of the technology and gaining an understanding of current state vs. desired state can help organizations in these important ways:

- Understand and compare options for solving business problems
- Focus time, energy, and resources on the right priorities
- Identify the budget and resources needed to move ahead
- Establish a baseline to show improvement over time

## The SharePoint Maturity model (SPMM)

Around the time SharePoint 2010 was released, [Sadie Van Buren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadalit/) developed a powerful set of concepts embodied in the SharePoint Maturity Model (SPMM). The basic idea was to give people working with the platform ways to:

- Understand their capabilities along multiple dimensions on a clearly defined scale
- Decide which level they would like to achieve for each dimension and in what time frame
- Improve their capabilities in tangible ways by progressing to the next level
- Compare their organization to their peers based on quantified surveys

The SPMM was, of course, focused squarely on SharePoint. At the time, SharePoint was exclusively an on premises product and generally stood alone, unless you did a lot of work to change things. The *principles*, however, remain valid.

The tools have changed, but we still see similar levels of capability when using Document Libraries:

- Team-centric - mostly document storage
- Cross-enterprise and fuller functionality
- External collaboration

These three high-level distinctions are levels of capability we in the practitioner community see every day in our work. Some organizations are totally fine using SharePoint as a shared folder in the cloud, but most want to be working smarter than that. But how can they know what their path should be? And how can they get there?

### Underpinnings: the Capability Maturity Model

SPMM was based on  the [Capability Maturity Model (CMM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model), which originally came out of work at Carnegie Mellon University and focused on software development. The premise was if you could measure yourself against a clear set of standards to identify where your practices and capabilities stood, you could take concrete steps to progress to the next level. The model defined a 5 point scale, representing the levels:

- Initial
- Repeatable
- Defined
- Managed (Capable)
- Optimizing (Efficient).

Not every organization needs to be at the top level. NASA and Boeing have different goals, constraints, and risks to manage than a small marketing or retail organization. As with any organizational capability, the organization should decide if the capability should be a strategic differentiator or simply a basic operational capability based on the organizational strategy. The former may require optimized and foolproof capabilities, where the latter only requires relative efficiency.

## What's Next?

The goal of expanding the SPMM to the Microsoft 365 level is to help practitioners in the community think through how they can improve their capabilities or decide which capabilities matter most to them. These decisions should be based not just on the technology capabilities themselves, but driven by specific outcome objectives derived from the organizational strategy.

In future articles, we will expand the model several layers deeper. Have thoughts? Add your feedback below.
