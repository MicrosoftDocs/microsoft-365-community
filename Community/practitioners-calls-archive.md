### Practical Scenario Copilot Adoption Level 300

November 2025 | Slides: [PDF](media/practiners-call-archive/2025/Practitioners%202025-11-18%20-%20Practical%20Scenario%20Copilot%20Adoption%20Level%20300.pdf) | Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1BHHTVBjtQ" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

**Speaker(s):** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pialangenkrans/" target="_blank">Pia Langenkrans, MVP</a>

**Summary:** Pia presented a practical scenario for Copilot adoption focused on reaching maturity level 300. She challenged the common perception that many organizations at level 200 (with champions programs, some training, and limited licenses) are actually in a dangerous "honeymoon phase" that builds technical and organizational debt.

Referencing the Apoint report, she showed that 81.9% expect ROI within 12 months but 85.7% actually slow down their rollouts. The main problem isn't change management or AI training - it's poor data quality, inaccurate output, and hallucinations that hinder adoption.

Reaching level 300 requires parallel work across three core competencies: Business Processes (documented, measurable processes ready for automation), Staff and Training (HR-driven, mandatory training where managers must go first), and Management of Content (taxonomy, metadata, ROT cleanup, and lifecycle management). Pia emphasized that information architecture isn't something AI can help with - it's something AI needs to work.

She also argued forcefully that managers, not IT, will become "bosses" of agents in the future because they understand business processes, and that champions programs need to be structured with at least 4 hours monthly commitment to prevent burnout. The budget discussion revealed tension between IT budgets and business needs.

### Revisiting the Communications Competency

October 2025 | Slides: [PDF](media/practiners-call-archive/2025/Practitioners%202025-10-21%20-%20Revisiting%20the%20Communications%20Competency.pdf) | Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c3tSHdf0cg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

**Speaker(s):** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anokheetara/" target="_blank">Tara Saylor</a>

**Summary:** Tara Saylor presented an updated perspective on the Communications competency, bringing her unique experience as a corporate communications professional who moved to enterprise IT. She walked through the maturity levels with practical examples, emphasizing that Level 100 is ad hoc and demand-driven (appropriate for small organizations), Level 200 introduces distributed channels without coordination, Level 300 adds governance and repeatable processes with targeting and feedback, Level 400 involves sophisticated listening and adjustment (exemplified by her COVID task force work with weekly newsletters and Reddit scraping), and Level 500 treats internal communications like external marketing with personalized journeys.

She also explored how AI/Copilot fits into organizational communications at each level, from experimental (100-200) to approved tools with training (300) to predictable, trusted use (400) to mass customization (500).

The presentation reinforced that "technology needs the business to make communications work" - IT can build the infrastructure but requires content owners to make it useful. Tara emphasized that communications complexity should match the channel bandwidth (simple tactical messages via text, complex strategic messages face-to-face) and that regulation, localization, and cultural considerations add layers of complexity. A critical insight for AI adoption was "IIA before AI" (Information Architecture before Artificial Intelligence) - LLMs only work reliably when content is well-organized, properly secured, and metadata-rich.

She highlighted AI's strengths in accessibility (automatic transcripts, real-time translations, alt-text generation) and specific communication tasks like SharePoint's FAQ generation tool and summarization features, which work well because they operate within defined scopes. The shift from one-way CEO blogs to two-way employee-generated content (via Viva Engage/Yammer) represents a fundamental change in organizational communications, and AI's ability to provide mass customization lets end users reformat content to their preferences without burdening communicators.

### Business Process & Search Competency Update

September 2025 | Slides: [PDF](media/practiners-call-archive/2025/Practitioners%202025-09-16%20-%20Business%20Process%20%26%20Search%20Competency%20Update.pdf) | Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mReMv9HgTg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

**Speaker(s):** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonjhudson/" target="_blank">Simon Hudson, MVP</a>

**Summary:** Simon Hudson presented substantial rewrites to both the Business Process and Search competencies, modernizing them for the Copilot/AI era. Each competency received approximately 30 new or changed characteristics (excluding level 100 in Business Process, which "was already as rubbish as it could be"). The Business Process competency now emphasizes user experience design, citizen development management, and the importance of Statistical Process Control (SPC). At level 500, it introduces concepts like enabling power users with governed freedom to adapt workflows rapidly, digital twins for simulating business processes, and innovative automation methods.

The Search competency underwent a conceptual shift from "search" to "discovery," with renewed emphasis on metadata and taxonomy despite Microsoft's attempts to downplay them. The session opened with the sobering news that core team member Simon Doy had suffered a heart attack at age 40 but was recovering well.

The updates reflect a fundamental rethinking of how AI interacts with traditional capabilities. For Search, Simon emphasized that the goal is helping people "know things" rather than just "find things," with AI-enhanced search providing digestible summaries and multimodal capabilities (text, voice, images, video) at higher maturity levels. However, the session reinforced that "Copilot is not pilot" - human review remains critical, and AI is not the answer for everything.

A compelling discussion emerged around content lifecycle management when Avashek shared how their 84-year-old manufacturing company discovered Copilot surfacing decades-old help desk numbers alongside current ones. Diego's discovery that Azure-generated image tags labeled healthcare workers as "sexy, attractive, gorgeous" highlighted AI's dangerous context failures and the continued importance of human-curated metadata. The consensus was that while AI enables powerful new capabilities, organizations need strong information architecture, metadata governance, and lifecycle management as prerequisites - echoing the earlier session's "IIA before AI" principle. Search-driven experiences still have distinct value versus AI-driven ones, and knowing when to use which approach is a critical skill.

### Process Improvement Practical Scenario - AMA

June 2025 | Slides: [PDF](media/practiners-call-archive/2025/Practitioners%202025-06-17%20-%20Process%20Improvement%20Practical%20Scenario%20%20-%20AMA.pdf) | Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nNP1CzgnAE" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

**Speaker(s):** Carol Zollinger

**Summary:** Carol Zollinger presented a detailed practical scenario showing how she transformed a chaotic timesheet correction process at a mental health residential facility from level 100 to approximately level 300. The original problem involved direct care workers on 24/7 shifts who couldn't fix their own timesheet errors, supervisors drowning in email requests (hundreds daily), and missed approval deadlines causing payroll chaos.

Carol built a ticketing system using Microsoft Lists, Power Automate (5 flows), and Forms with status-based automation (Open → Resolved/Escalated → Escalated to Payroll). The solution featured JSON-formatted clickable resolve/escalate buttons, automated daily reminders when tickets were open, and email notifications when tickets were resolved. She targeted four competencies: Business Process (clear workflow and visibility), Collaboration (any supervisor could fix any ticket), Employee Experience (simple mobile-friendly form), and Management of Content (standardized format and audit trail).

Carol's design philosophy centered on making compliance easy: "Here's what I want people to do. How can I make it easy for them to obey me?" She emphasized Mark's quote "tech cannot fix humans" - noting that supervisors initially found it easier not to enforce the process, but paid for it later. Her rollout strategy proved crucial: she trained supervisors first (who were "super excited"), and they rolled it out in their regular meetings, essentially doing the selling for her.

Success came quietly - when she heard nothing, she feared no one was using it, but checking the list showed people were simply using it without issues. She included inline documentation carefully calibrated for users who'd done the task once before (not introductory, not exhaustive). The session also featured Ralph demonstrating an M365 Copilot agent built for the maturity model itself, sparking discussion about using agents to help navigate the massive model content. A significant technical discussion emerged about upcoming MFA enforcement on service accounts in October 2024, with suggestions to use service principals with certificates instead of password-based service accounts for running Power Automate flows.

### Security Culture

May 2025 | Slides: [PDF](media/practiners-call-archive/2025/Practitioners%202025-05-20%20-%20Security%20Culture.pdf) | Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0CaGHVmwR4" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

**Speaker(s):** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matswarnolf/" target="_blank">Mats Warnolf, MVP</a>

**Summary:** Mats presented on security culture, distinguishing it fundamentally from information security (systems, policies, controls like Defender for Endpoints and conditional access). He emphasized that while information security is about architecture and IT/cybersecurity working behind the scenes, security culture is about people, habits, and values - "behavior and habits, not checkboxes."

His core message: "compliance and culture are not the same thing" - compliance is about following rules, ticking boxes, and meeting minimums out of fear, while culture is about caring, understanding why rules exist, and following them when no one's watching. Mats presented the maturity model progression from Level 100 (no culture, security is IT's job, first instinct when something goes wrong: "I hope nobody noticed") through Level 300 (security normalized, integrated into processes, reporting is seen as normal not shameful) to Level 500 (adaptive living system where everyone shares responsibility, mistakes are discussed openly, and the question becomes "how do we stay curious and ready?").

Drawing on James Clear's *Atomic Habits*, Mats outlined five rules for building security habits: make it obvious (visibility through cues like sensitivity labels, login screens, posters), make it easy (one-click incident reporting, password managers), make it attractive (celebrate secure actions, "make heroes"), make it satisfying (instant feedback: "thanks for reporting this, you may have prevented a breach"), and anchor to identity ("we are a secure company," "we protect our customers"). The key insight: "people don't rise to the level of policies, they fall to the level of habits."

Leadership must be visibly involved - "culture is shaped by what leaders talk about and what they ignore." Creating psychological safety is paramount: "no blaming, no shaming" with the principle that people should be rewarded for doing the right thing rather than punished for accidentally doing wrong. Measuring culture requires multiple lenses: inspection (formal structures), surveys (employee perceptions), interviews (understanding the why behind behavior), observation (watch what they do not what they say), and testing (though phishing tests can create false security).

The rich discussion included Carol's story of an employee fooled by a compromised lawyer's email who immediately reported it, preventing data loss - this became a teaching moment about catching mistakes early. Simon warned about AI-driven voice phishing attacks ("very polite young Londoner"). Best practices emerged: public recognition in Viva Engage, leaderboards for catching phishing, automatic training enrollment for failures, and always providing auto-responders rather than letting people "report into the void."

### Practical Scenario on Branding

April 2025 | Slides: [PDF](media/practiners-call-archive/2025/Practitioners%202025-04-15%20-%20Practical%20Scenario%20on%20Branding.pdf) | Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b36ZFdLdnw8" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

**Speaker(s):** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonjhudson/" target="_blank">Simon Hudson, MVP</a>

**Summary:** Simon Hudson presented a practical scenario on brand management, opening with the fundamental principle that "brands are absolutely not a logo and some colors" - that's level 100 thinking. True branding is about the method and stance you take on communicating to your preferred audience. He outlined six core principles: understanding your organizational tribe (target audience), differentiation, consistency across time and geographies, authenticity (who you really are, not who you'd like to be), emotional appeal that builds loyalty, and flexibility to adjust to market changes.

In a remarkably authentic move, Simon used his own newly-started company (only three weeks old) as a real-world example of being at level 100-200, noting "I wrote this scenario before I started the new company, so this is a very reflective exercise." The maturity progression moved from Level 100 (logo/colors exist, each department does its own marketing, weak brand identity) through Level 300 (detailed guidelines published, staff trained, senior management aligned, consistent across touchpoints) to Level 500 (multinational sophistication with global/regional variations, horizon scanning, brand moves dynamically with market changes).

Unlike most competencies, Simon noted "there are actually in the branding world quite a lot of 500 organizations" - exceptional brand maturity is achievable. The session revealed practical tools participants weren't aware of: Pia highlighted the Fluent UI Theme Designer (now integrated into SharePoint Brand Center), and Simon demonstrated the PowerPoint "golden template" Microsoft released that is Copilot-compatible, though he admitted "I don't like all of the layouts." A critical technical insight emerged about the fragmented branding landscape across Microsoft 365 - participants must visit 3-4 different locations: admin center's custom themes (navbar/suite bar colors), Power Platform logos, Stream/Clipchamp branding, and Viva Engage settings.

Sean Brown shared his organizational asset library challenge: categorizing templates for different regions (US, EU, Japan) without creating a mess, with suggestions to use permissions or content types. Simon's expertise showed when discussing his previous role as international brand manager for clinical products, where he managed six global brands and created "carefully crafted authentic stories" about wound healing - acknowledging it as "positive reinforcement manipulation to make sure people understand how great the things you do really are." The memorable quote: "Registering is trivial. That's just another form. Building your brand, finding the right combination of names and logos and domains... that's very very hard." Pia lamented her own struggle naming "Cruise Control 365" (trademark conflicts).

### Maturity Model and AI Agents

March 2025 | Slides: [PDF](media/practiners-call-archive/2025/Practitioners%202025-03-18%20-%20Maturity%20Model%20and%20AI%20Agents.pdf) | Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI_452J6Trc" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

**Speaker(s):** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simondoy/" target="_blank">Simon Doy, MVP</a>

**Summary:** Simon Doy presented a new practical scenario on AI agents and how organizations can mature in their use of them. He defined AI agents as "junior team members" driven by large language models (LLM) that differ from Copilot by being able to be triggered by external events, not just user requests. Through a practical walkthrough of a sales process, he showed how agents can be introduced gradually - from manual Copilot use (researching companies in chat) to automated agents triggered when a lead enters the CRM system. The critical insight: "human in the loop" is essential - when agents create content, humans must review it before it proceeds. The maturity progression goes from Level 100 (experimenting in Copilot Chat/Studio, not in production) through Level 200 (piloting use cases with business teams) to Level 300 (guidelines for test/delivery, agents used daily) up to Level 400 (measurement, feedback, dashboard over agents) and Level 500 (agents across the organization improving performance).

The presentation identified five critical competencies for AI agent maturity: **Cognitive Business** (the transition from humans doing everything to humans+AI as a team), **Governance, Risk & Compliance** (AI strategy, responsible AI policies, managing "agent sprawl" that will resemble SharePoint sprawl), **Staff and Training** (users AND developers need training, managing fear that AI takes jobs), **Management of Content** (agents depend on high-quality content, archive old content outside scope), and **Customization and Development** (DevOps thinking with test/staging/prod environments). Terrence expressed concern about consumption-based cost models but suggested it might need to be expensive to discourage waste of computing power - he gave the example of someone building monstrous AI prompts for route planning instead of coding an elegant app. Pia emphasized that organizations must treat AI agents as real DevOps: "we can't just run and see when it breaks like we do with M365 admin - we need to think like real developers." David highlighted the problem of personal agents in document libraries becoming "orphaned" upon terminations. The discussion about responsible AI became intense when Simon mentioned an example from the Copilot Connection podcast about someone building an agent to profile people as potential psychopaths - Teams AI gave him a warning for using the word "psychopath." Terrence concluded by emphasizing the leadership vacuum: many organizations lack vision for AI and leave IT to "muddle through" while employees fear being replaced - leaders need to take a stand and communicate "we will not replace people with AI" (at least for now).

### How to run a Maturity Model Workshop

February 2025 | Slides: [PDF](media/practiners-call-archive/2025/Practitioners%202025-02-18%20-%20How%20to%20run%20a%20Maturity%20Model%20Workshop.pdf) | Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnZUcyzYcv0" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

**Speaker(s):** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcanderson" target="_blank">Marc D Anderson, MVP</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonjhudson/" target="_blank">Simon Hudson, MVP</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simondoy/" target="_blank">Simon Doy, MVP</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharonweaver/" target="_blank">Sharon Weaver</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/galenkeene/" target="_blank">Galen Keene</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pialangenkrans/" target="_blank">Pia Langenkrans, MVP</a><br><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matswarnolf/" target="_blank">Mats Warnolf, MVP</a>

**Summary:** Pia led a practical session on how to conduct a maturity model workshop using the fictional company "Pancom" - a communications agency with fragmented workflows, dissatisfied customers, and old systems. The core team created several role-play videos (which they themselves admitted were "method acting") where they played different characters: Mark as legal ("completely ignoring the rest of us - that is the best part"), Simon as a salesperson with local templates on his computer, and Pia as HR. The critical incident: "poor George" dropped his laptop on the train with sensitive data and two months of work - the laptop was too old for remote deletion, lacked cloud backup, and ran Windows 7 because "George he's an old guy he doesn't want to learn new things."

The workshop showed how to gradually get participants to realize where they actually are - from initial "I'm guessing we're 300 or so and we're better than some other people" to realistic assessment around 180-230. The key was to get ALL perspectives in the room (IT, HR, communications, facility, legal) and ask the right questions instead of giving answers directly.

The workshop's success depends on getting the right people in the room and managing different personalities - "there are people who are afraid, there are people who are pushy and not listening to other people in the room." Pia emphasized that the goal is not to measure but to create understanding: "when organizations start learning about these things they just get more stressed because they understand how much there is out there that they don't understand... so it's important to give them a roadmap." Mark made an important point about avoiding "boiling the ocean" - not everyone needs to be 500 everywhere: "few organizations have that NASA kind of critical mission maturity required all the time - if they get to level 300 on management of content they're more than happy, but security might need to be higher." Sharon mentioned that she interviews certain people separately and then presents the results. A critical discussion arose about Copilot maturity when Sean asked about his organization which "are like Windows one, not Windows 7, and they want to use Copilot" - the team emphasized that Copilot requires baseline maturity in several competencies (permissions must be in order otherwise Copilot finds "all kinds of things you didn't want it to find"). Simon Hudson pointed out that the maturity model is "technology agnostic" while Microsoft focuses on specific products - they try to achieve different goals. Pia also emphasized the importance of not expecting people to learn faster than is realistic: "we really hit the roof on that - we can't expect people just to learn this, we need more structure and order."

### Getting Leadership Buy In

January 2025 | Slides: [PDF](media/practiners-call-archive/2025/Practitioners%202025-01-21%20-%20Getting%20Leadership%20Buy%20In.pdf) | Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sE-u4Q94ZOw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>

**Speaker(s):** <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pialangenkrans/" target="_blank">Pia Langenkrans, MVP</a>

**Summary:** Pia delivered a masterclass on securing leadership buy-in for maturity model initiatives, opening with the blunt truth: "Why is leadership buy-in so hard? Because we in IT are doing it wrong and yes it is our problem." She explained that IT professionals talk in technical details while leadership thinks in big picture terms - when IT comes complaining about "the oars and the wood isn't very good," leadership sees it as "a you problem."

The session centered around "Pancom," a fictional 80-person PR/communications agency where CEO Gail struggled to connect client complaints and internal frustrations until a crisis hit: senior consultant George left his computer on a train containing highly sensitive client data. The computer was too old for remote wipe, not enrolled in Intune, had no cloud backup training, and ran Windows 7 because "George is an old guy he doesn't want to learn new things." The crisis meeting itself "needed a crisis meeting" with everyone pointing fingers. This incident catalyzed a quick assessment workshop revealing an average maturity of 156 across eight competencies, with a 12-month target of 279 (an increase of 132 points). Pia emphasized: "Most of the time when leadership really listens is based on an incident - worst case scenario it's an incident you have internally, best case scenario you can build on someone else's mistake."

Pia provided a one-page leadership decision slide that she described as "atrocious for a PowerPoint slide, this is how they like to see things" - leadership takeaways focused on future competitiveness ("nobody wants to be obsolete"), employee empowerment (recruitment costs are huge), and AI-readiness. She stressed: "If you want management to listen, you can't send them long emails or Word documents - they do everything in PowerPoint." The psychological barriers include fear of appearing incompetent about technical matters ("imagine learning Japanese - if you teach hello and count to five they'll remember, but if you continue with complex conversations they remember nothing"), concerns about organizational disruption (people become paralyzed during changes), and anxiety about being accountable for failed decisions that cost millions.

Leadership resistance tactics include: deflection ("not my table"), analysis paralysis (endless requests for more information), token agreements (verbal support but no budget/people), silent sabotage (avoiding meetings), delegation without direction (sending junior people with no mandate), dismissive attitudes ("nice to have not must have"), and excessive risk aversion (in Sweden: "the cloud gives everything to the American military"). **Proactive strategies**: Use competitors' failures as cautionary tales ("this is the risk I'm proposing - here's what happened to someone who ignored it"), get management arguing with each other rather than with you (put sales next to legal: "if I do all that we don't sell anything" vs "these are compliance requirements"), gossip everything to everyone in one-on-ones before meetings so "everyone thinks everyone else is hearing it for the first time," and use the "management tripwire" trick - deliberately include one visible but insignificant error so managers feel they've contributed. Daniel raised the frustration of identifying risks at project start only to have them become realities at the end - Pia confirmed using storytelling works better than dry technical terms. The pong game analogy was brilliant: an IT manager showed leadership the old Pong game and said "our system was designed when this was popular."
