# Practical Scenarios - Enhancing Brand Management

[!INCLUDE [content-disclaimer](includes/content-disclaimer.md)]

## Overview

This practical scenario uses the concepts and characteristics from appropriate [Maturity Model for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/community/index-mm4m365) competencies to address the specific development of brand management in organizations. It focuses on ensuring brand development, consistency and use across an organization. It uses the same underpinning criteria as elsewhere in the Maturity Model and allows organizations to decide how mature their approach to branding should be for them and what actions, policies and technologies should be used to reach that level.

## Understanding effective branding

Effective branding is far more than simply a logo and some colors. It should be a strategic tool that drives multiple business benefits and differentiators:

- **Identity and Recognition**: Branding helps create a memorable identity for a business, making it easily recognizable to customers. This includes visual elements like logos, colors, and typography.
- **Trust and Credibility**: A strong brand builds trust and credibility with customers, signaling reliability and quality.
- **Emotional Connection**: Effective branding creates an emotional connection with customers, fostering [loyalty and long-term relationships](https://brilliantio.com/what-is-the-purpose-of-branding/).
- **Competitive Advantage**: Branding differentiates a business from its competitors, highlighting unique values and benefits.
- **Consistency**: It ensures consistency in messaging and customer experience across all touch points.

### Principles of effective branding

1. **Understand Your Audience**: Know your target audience’s values, needs, and preferences to create relevant and resonant branding.
2. **Differentiation**: Stand out by being unique rather than just better. Offer a distinct brand experience or philosophy.
3. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent brand message and visual identity across all platforms and communications.
4. **Authenticity**: Be genuine and true to your brand values and mission. Authenticity builds trust and loyalty.
5. **Emotional Appeal**: Connect with your audience on an emotional level through storytelling and brand values.
6. **Flexibility**: Adapt to changes in the market and customer preferences while maintaining core brand values.

### Challenges

1. **Maintaining Consistency**: Ensuring consistent use of brand elements across all channels and touch points can be challenging.
2. **Adapting to Market Trends**: Keeping the brand relevant in a rapidly changing market requires continuous adaptation.
3. **Building and Sustaining Trust**: Establishing and maintaining customer trust is crucial but can be difficult, especially in competitive markets.
4. **Standing Out in a Saturated Market**: Differentiating the brand in a crowded marketplace is a common challenge.
5. **Navigating Digital Landscapes**: Effectively managing the brand’s presence across various digital platforms and social media.
6. **Employee Alignment**: Ensuring all employees understand and embody the brand values and message.

## Applying the Maturity Model to Brand Management

### Level 100: Initial

**Scenario:** A small startup has a logo and a basic color scheme but lacks comprehensive brand guidelines. Each department creates its own marketing materials as a need arises, resulting in inconsistent use of fonts, colors, and messaging. The brand identity is weak and often confused with competitors; potential customers are unable to describe what the company purpose or differentiator is.

- Branding is not considered as a process or a strategic business differentiator.
- There is no brand guidance for staff. Logos, corporate colors, and other elements are ad hoc, naïve, and mostly evident only on the website.
- Some documents and slide decks have branding elements, added by the author, and using whatever assets they have or can find, often cut from the website.
- Such branding as there is lacks consistency.
- Little, if any, thought has been given to what the brand is intended to communicate.
- It is likely that the use of brand echoes weaknesses in company culture, governance and employee engagement.

#### 100 Development actions & activities

- **Awareness:** Introduce the basic concepts of brand identity to staff and management. Outline the core brand elements: logos, fonts, colors, imagery, tone of voice.
- **Brand definition**: Define organizational personality and values to be represented by the brand asset, based on thinking around:
  - Know Your Audience and identify your ‘tribe’, the people you really want as your supporters and influencers.
  - Define your story; what you want people to know about you and say about you.
  - Identify your key differentiators; what it is like doing business with you and why you offer the products and services you do. This is the basis for your brand promise.
  - Read more about [branding concepts](https://fabrikbrands.com/branding-matters/branding/branding-and-brand-essentials/)
- **Build brand assets:** Create core brand elements to support your brand. Review these to ensure they meet accessibility standards and work across digital and print. Create template documents and slide decks (Word .dotx and PowerPoint .potx files) and store these in the brand folder.
- **Share assets and brand:** Create a shared location for storing core brand assets. Upload essential brand assets (e.g., logos, primary color palette, etc.) to shared location.

### Level 200: Managed

**Scenario:** The company becomes aware that its brand is ineffective and starts to formalize the approach.

- Senior management have agreed what the organization brand is intended to communicate, which might include a vision, mission statement, business principles and public strategy.
- A basic brand guide is created and published for all staff, defining logos and their use, corporate fonts, corporate colors (with their RGB, Hex and Pantone codes), trademarks and their definitive use. Consideration is given to tone of voice.
- The brand guide is circulated to staff and published to the intranet.
- Brand assets, notably company logos and images in appropriate file formats, are created and stored for use by staff in all areas of the organization. This might be in (in increasing order of good practice): a shared server; shared folder on OneDrive; a brand library on SharePoint.
- Staff are briefed on the importance and use of the brand. This is supported by some documentation and brand related processes, including approvals for public facing communications.
- Management of the brand and brand assets are attached to defined roles and responsibilities.
- Staff are asked to review all their existing documents and collateral and update them to the new standard.
- A core set of company templates (Word documents and PowerPoint slide decks) are created for the most common needs and staff are told to use these as the basis for their documents.
- Signage and other physical representations of the brand are updated to be consistent with the new approach.
- Staff are told to create and use email signatures in a standard ‘on-brand’ format.

- **Asset Organization:** Categorize types of brand assets (e.g., Logos, Templates, Fonts) and how/where they should be used (internal, external, social media, formal reports, and articles, etc.).

The brand guidelines and other brand related documents are published to a library here; these are supplemented with further information using SharePoint pages, exposing the key content of the brand guidelines.
- Marketing/ Comms are responsible for managing the backend of Brand Centre and have set up brand colors and fonts. Core themes have been produced from these to define the intranet look and feel and site owners are requested to use these themes.
