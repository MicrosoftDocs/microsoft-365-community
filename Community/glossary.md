# Microsoft 365 Glossary

[!INCLUDE [content-disclaimer](includes/content-disclaimer.md)]

As with any technology, there are lots of terms we toss around to explain things. Just understanding what each term means can be half the battle. Whether you are entirely new to Microsoft 365 or have been using it for years, there are always new terms to learn. The fact that Microsoft uses common English words for many capabilities can add an additional layer of confusion.

This Glossary is an attempt to demystify some of the terms and acronyms we use every day in working with the platform. See one missing? Feel free to add an Issue with what you want added.

Also consider checking out the additional glossaries listed in the [Additional Resources](#additional-resources) section.

[A](#a) [B](#b) [C](#c) [D](#d) [E](#e) [F](#f) [G](#g) [H](#h) [I](#i) [J](#j) [K](#k) [L](#l) [M](#m) [N](#n) [O](#o) [P](#p) [Q](#q) [R](#r) [S](#s) [T](#t) [U](#u) [V](#v) [W](#w) [X](#x) [Y](#y) [Z](#z)

Add members to groups in Microsoft 365 to simplify administration.

### Group

A Group in SharePoint can generally refer to one of three things. It may mean:

#### SharePoint Group

  A container to organize users and other security groups. A SharePoint group can be assigned permission levels on an object such as a site, a list or library, a folder or a document (or page, or item). Generally only a Site Owner can manage who is in a SharePoint Group.

#### Microsoft 365 Group
  
A Microsoft 365 Groups is a concept which lets the members of the Group easily collaborate. It provides a collection of resources such as a shared Outlook mailbox including a shared calendar, a SharePoint [Team site](#team-site) with a document library and a Notebook, as well as a Planner Board, a Power BI workspace and a Stream Video portal.

A Group is the foundation of a Microsoft Teams Team. A Team gives users within that Group channels to collaborate in the context that is relevant to their work and the ability to have scheduled and ad-hoc meetings. Teams can be public (they can be accessed by everyone inside of the organization), private (users need to be invited explicitly) or org-wide (everyone in the organization is automatically a member of this team). Roles and permissions are simplified to Owner (create, delete, manage memberships), Member (collaborate, create channels and add tabs) and Guest. Guests are outside of the organization and need to be added explicitly as an External User, otherwise they can't see nor access a Team. They can only work in the structure provided to them, which means they can't add tabs, apps or channels.
  
#### Security Group

  A security group is a container of users defined in Active Directory, one or more of these can be added to SharePoint Groups. Adding users in the security groups applies permissions in SharePoint.

### Idempotent

In a development sense, idempotent means that code you run more than once with the same inputs will always produce the same outputs. In other words, you can always expect the same effects, no matter how many times you do something.

### [Identity Models](/microsoft-365/enterprise/deploy-identity-solution-identity-model)

Microsoft 365 uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), a cloud-based user identity and authentication service that is included with your Microsoft 365 subscription, to manage identities and authentication for Microsoft 365. Getting your identity infrastructure configured correctly is vital to managing Microsoft 365 user access and permissions for your organization.

### [Information Barriers](/microsoft-365/compliance/information-barriers)

Microsoft cloud services include powerful communication and collaboration capabilities. But suppose that you want to restrict communication and collaboration between two groups to avoid a conflict of interest from occurring in your organization. Or, perhaps you want to restrict communication and collaboration between certain people inside your organization in order to safeguard internal information. Microsoft 365 enables communication and collaboration across groups and organizations, so is there a way to restrict communication and collaboration among specific groups of users when necessary? With information barriers, you can!

### [List](https://support.microsoft.com/office/introduction-to-lists-0a1c3ace-def0-44af-b225-cfa8d92c52d7)

A List in SharePoint is a table used to store information in a SharePoint site. A list has columns that can be used to store different types of information, and each row in a list is known as an "Item". SharePoint attempts you to very carefully design lists if you attempt to store "large" amounts of data (more than 5,000 items), including things like limiting the number of "Lookup Columns" that can be used. Therefore, if you are planning on storing more than a few thousand items, be sure to follow Microsoft guidelines on storing large amounts of data in lists.

An item in a list can have multiple file attachments added. This is useful if you use a custom list as an Issue Tracker for example, and want to be able to add screenshots to an item in.

A library is a type of list where documents or other files are added as items, but no further file attachments can be added.

### [Live Events (Teams)](/microsoftteams/teams-live-events/what-are-teams-live-events)

### Managed Metadata

Managed Metadata is a SharePoint feature that allows the business to create a hierarchy of terms that can be used in SharePoint Sites to tag content. This is used by creating the hierarchy using Term Groups and Term Sets, then adding a column to a list of type "Managed Metadata" and setting the Term Set to use for tagging. When an item is added to that list or library, the new column is used to tag that item or document.

### [Managed Property](/sharepoint/manage-search-schema#create-a-new-managed-property)

A Managed Property is one of the basic units of the SharePoint Search Schema. It's an entry in the Schema that you refer to when doing search queries that use specific properties, or when specifying which information you want to return.

Managed Properties can be created (if you have the appropriate permissions), although SharePoint automatically creates Managed Properties that are useful for a wide range of scenarios.

## N

### [Namespace](/training/modules/m365-messaging-manage-client-access/plan-namespaces)

A namespace refers to the conventions we use to determine major and minor names within a specific domain. For example, we need to use the /sites namespace carefully so we don't have collisions. If Harold Robinson wants to create a site at /sites/HRm, then Human Resources will have a problem.

In programming, namespaces can be far more complex - like List.Fields within Microsoft.SharePoint.Client - but we worry about namespacing in our day-to-day lives, too.  It wouldn't work very well if all our children were named Daryl.

## T

### Targeted Release

Targeted Release is an option to receive updates to the platform earlier than with [Standard Release](#standard-release) Targeted Release should *not* be used in production tenants (you need to decide how you define this), as there are occasions where Target Release functionality is buggy or is withdrawn. Consider it similar to the old term "beta".

Targeted Release can be enabled in two ways: per tenant and per user. The two different ways of setting this preference result in different changes. Some updates only make sense in the context of a tenant (e.g., Communication sites) and others can make sense in the context of a person. Giving users Targeted Release does *not* mean they will see all updates sooner, only those which make sense in a person context.

Finally, once you have Targeted Release turned on, it is very hard to go back. Your users will be used to new functionality, and you would be removing it. Thus the warning above about not using Targeted Release in a production tenant is also relevant from a change management perspective..
