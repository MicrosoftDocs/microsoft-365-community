# The Microsoft 365 Maturity Model – Governance, Risk, and Compliance Competency

![Maturity Model for Microsoft 365](media/maturity-model-for-microsoft-365/M365MM.png)

## Overview of the Concepts [tl;dr]

Organizations face increasing complexity and change in regulatory environments, calling for a more structured approach for managing Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC). A key enabler of compliance success is Information Architecture (IA), ensuring that data and documents are properly categorized, tagged, and structured to enhance efficiency and control.

The Governance, Risk, and Compliance Competency is focused on helping an organization reduce risk and improve compliance effectiveness by implementing a framework for compliance and risk management.

### Governance, Risk and Compliance framework

:::image type="content" source="media/microsoft365-maturity-model--governance-and-compliance/grc-framework.png" alt-text="Governance, Risk and Compliance framework":::

## Definition of this competency

**Governance** is the system of rules, practices, and processes an organization uses to direct and control its activities. Many governance activities arise from external standards, obligations and expectations. It also provides a framework for attaining a company's objectives and encompasses most areas management, from action plans and internal controls to performance measurement and corporate disclosure.

**Risk** enables an organization to evaluate all relevant business and regulatory risks and controls and monitor mitigation actions in a structured manner.

**Compliance** refers to the country/region, state or federal laws or even multi-national regulations such as GDPR regulations that an organization must follow. These regulations define what types of data must be protected, what processes are required under the legislation, and what penalties are issued to organizations that fail to comply.

For Microsoft 365, this means implementing specific policies, operational processes, and technical controls to protect the data in Microsoft and cover some or all of using, storing, sharing, disclosing, erasing and destruction of data. The data should also be secured appropriately to guard against loss, theft and misuse.

A critical enabler of governance, risk, and compliance is **Information Architecture (IA)**, which ensures data and documents are structured, categorized, and governed effectively. IA supports compliance by:

- Giving **end users** a clear understanding of where information should be stored and how it should be classified.
- Enabling **information owners** to manage changes in governance frameworks and legal requirements effectively.
- Allowing **legal and compliance teams** to quickly gain an overview of risks and identify areas requiring immediate attention.
- Providing **management teams** with visibility into whether they are following established governance frameworks and where improvements are needed.
- Helping **IT and system owners** identify sensitive data, apply appropriate security measures, and align new technological solutions with organizational resilience strategies.

Without a structured Information Architecture, organizations face increased risks of compliance failures, inefficient data management, and security vulnerabilities. Unstructured or ad-hoc data storage results in poor findability, high costs for eDiscovery, and an inability to meet regulatory retention and privacy obligations. By embedding IA into their compliance strategies, organizations ensure that governance is predictable, scalable, and automated—reducing risk and improving operational efficiency.

Smaller organizations may only need to comply with the baseline general data protection rules that apply to every organization. Other organizations must comply with industry-specific and/ or country/region specific regulations which may overlap and/or conflict.

Example compliance regulations are:

- CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act; USA)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation; Europe)
- HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act; USA)
- PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard; international)
- SOX (Sarbanes–Oxley Act; US)

**Compliance** is not the same as **security**, but security should be considered when building your plan as effective security is frequently a compliance requirement. Compliance requires only that the legally mandated minimum standards are met whereas data security covers all the processes, procedures and technologies that define how you look after sensitive data and guard against breaches.

To address the gap between compliance and security many organizations also follow compliance and regulatory frameworks, such as COBIT, ISO 27001, or ITIL. These provide guidelines and best practices to meet regulatory requirements, improve processes, strengthen security, and achieve other business objectives (such as adopting a ‘cloud-first’ strategy).

> [!NOTE]
> Some characteristics should, perhaps, be addressed a little more urgently than others; these have been marked with the 'Sparkles' emoji: ✨

### Level 100 - Initial

At level 100 maturity an organization does not believe that governance and compliance is important to its overall objectives.

Management does not consider investing in the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) related systems necessary for the overall business strategies. In addition, the organization does not assess the business impact of its vulnerabilities and it does not understand the risks involved due to these vulnerabilities.

Organizations at level 100 maturity pay little attention to compliance and are characterized by the absence of policies and procedures for information/ data compliance of governance.

The organization addresses compliance in a reactive mode — doing assessments when forced to. There is no ownership or monitoring of GRC. Management does not invest in a compliance framework, technology controls, or employee training to meet baseline standards for managing risks and remaining compliant with regulations and standards.

**[Initial level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-100---initial)** characteristics include:

#### People and Culture (100)

- The leadership team do not believe that compliance is fundamental to their overall objectives. It is a means to an end.
- Compliance obligations and risks are not understood.
- No individual or department is responsible for governance, risk and compliance, nor is it clear where these activities are taking place on a devolved basis
- Roles, training, and competencies needed for compliance are not developed. Employees are not aware of how compliance impacts their daily work.
- No training on technology usage—Users lack understanding of metadata, labels, and retention policies, leading to chaotic, inconsistent content classification.
- No defined roles for Information Architecture governance—Managers and business owners do not take responsibility for structuring information.
- Unclear ownership—anyone can create and share content without oversight.


#### Process (100)

- No process for keeping up with regulations that may affect their market and industry.
- GRC processes and controls are either absent or ad hoc or out of date.
- Risks assessments not undertaken.
- Compliance and governance obligations are not reviewed or monitored
- There is ad-hoc implementation and response to incidents (reactive).
- Compliance controls and evidence is ad hoc or does not exist.
- External sharing is unmanaged—users freely share content externally via email attachments, Teams invites, SharePoint sharing, and calendar invitations without oversight or tracking.
- No naming conventions for Teams, SharePoint sites, or documents.
- No metadata strategy—content is stored without categorization or retention considerations.
- Lack of Governance Policies for Information Architecture —Absence of policies and principles governing information management, leading to user overwhelm and inefficient content handling.


#### Technology (100)

- No standardized storage location for documentation, records and supporting evidence.
- No technical controls in place to support compliance.
- No usage of central taxonomy


#### Impacts (100)

Due to the lack of policies, controls and user training to support information/ data compliance in Microsoft 365 the organization is at risk of:

- Overlooking changes and/or additions to existing compliance requirements.
- Employees accidentally exposing sensitive data to third parties.
- Employees stealing information of value, such as customer lists or proprietary trade secrets.
- Consequences such as data breaches, erosion of customer trust, severe fines and other penalties due to non-compliance with regulations.
- Elevated eDiscovery costs.
- Lack of structured information leads to inefficiency—users spend excessive time searching for documents.
- Shadow IT emerges as employees create their own document storage solutions outside IT oversight.
- Unclear accountability for information governance, leading to uncontrolled site sprawl and data loss risks.

### Level 200 - Managed

At level 200 maturity an organization tends to believe governance and compliance is a series of boxes to check.

At this maturity level organizations acknowledge compliance regulations and standards. However, organizations may take a ‘tick box’ approach to Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC). Policies have been written, intended to avoid the damages that level 100 organizations can face, but the polices are not enforced in the organization.

**[Managed level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-200---managed)** characteristics include:

#### People and Culture (200)

- Leadership understands and accepts the importance of governance and compliance but has not driven it into the organization nor recognized it as a business enabler.
- Some policies have been written but are not enforced or comprehensively adopted.
- No formal compliance roles in place or roles have been allocated but without suitable training or assessment of competence. Governance, Risk and Compliance relies on individuals being responsible for actions and approaches in their own areas.
- No formal GRC training; communication is ad hoc or occurs in response to a GRC event. Most employees are not aware of how governance, risk and compliance impact their daily work.
- Training for information owners (e.g., managers)—Organizations begin training leaders to understand the importance of structured information, how data should be classified, and why governance matters.
- Discussions on metadata and retention policies begin but are not widely adopted.
- Ownership roles identified for information (e.g., Site Owners, Team Owners, Data Stewards), but not enforced.
- Ownership roles for content management are identified (e.g., Site Owners, Data Stewards), but they are not strictly enforced.


#### Process (200)

- Governance and compliance management is local, uncoordinated or sporadic It is dependent on individual people to action and monitor.
- ✨ Processes exist but are manual and lack standardization, making it hard to measure their effectiveness, enforce them or obtain an overview of activity and status.
- Limited collaboration between compliance and operational teams. Often compliance is an afterthought.
- Response to incidents is reactive /ad hoc, lacking consistency, formality and may result in ineffective actions.
- Risk management is perceived as a process.
- External sharing awareness emerges—the organization begins discussions on what should be shared externally but without formalized governance.
- Basic restrictions on external sharing—some organizations introduce guidelines but lack enforcement.
- Initial metadata framework is introduced, but usage is inconsistent across the organization.
- Basic site and document structure discussions begin, but they are not standardized.
- Discussions on content categorization and retention policies emerge, but adoption is limited.


#### Technology (200)

- ✨ Basic technical controls may exist but may not be appropriately implemented to ensure compliance.
- ✨ Technical controls to manage retention and deletion exist, however there are minimal processes to implement these effectively; retention and deletion is largely a manual, ad hoc activity, though there may be reminders and triggers in processes to act as prompts.
- Storage locations for documentation and supporting evidence are inconsistent and fragmented.
- There is a tendency to focus on email rather than a wider view of content and processes that need to be compliant.
- Basic metadata framework begins, but users are not required to follow structured tagging.

#### Impacts (200)

At this level you can expect the following:

- Employees see compliance as painful and "extra" to their day job.
- The organization is unaware of new and changing compliance laws and regulations so unaware of any new, increasing, or decreasing compliance risks.
- Organizations do not know what sensitive data they have, where it is, who can access it, and its risk of exposure. This makes it difficult to apply effective policies and controls to protect the most critical data assets. Organizations will retain nothing or everything ‘just in case’.
  - Information clutter and duplication degrades productivity.
  - The organization remains at risk from both deleted/lost information and from ‘over-retained’ information
- Action is only taken after a major violation or ‘near miss’ has occurred, to show they are trying to meet compliance standards. Even then, it is implemented as a tactical response to a serious problem, rather than a strategy for permanent improvement.
- Discovery exercises are costly and complex as no specialist tools are used.
- Limited metadata adoption leads to difficulty in organizing and finding information.
- Some compliance improvement, but retention policies are not systematically enforced.
- Growing awareness of external sharing risks, but lack of standardization creates security gaps.

### Level 300 - Defined

At level 300 maturity, an organization believes compliance is essential to the business. They begin to affect a ‘top-down’ cultural change in working to incorporate governance, risk and compliance-led practices. It’s understood that it is the job of executives to enforce adoption and training among managers, and the job of managers to do so with their staff.

A baseline compliance framework is implemented with a standardized set of policies and controls.

Processes measured and controlled

**[Defined level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-300---defined)** characteristics include:

#### People and Culture (300)

- ✨ The leadership team see compliance as essential to business continuity and may value the rigor as a business improvement tool.
- ✨ Compliance roles and responsibilities are assigned to accountable individuals, who have been trained but may lack expertise and experience. They understand the importance of the role and will reach out, reactively to legal and other experts for guidance and counsel.
- ✨ A Compliance framework, in some form, has been documented and communicated to process owners. However, the implementation decisions are left to local business and system owners so GRC initiatives are managed in silos.
- ✨ Training, education, and awareness are run annually. Staff have a broad awareness of their responsibilities.
- Compliance activities are frequently event driven, such as an audit or a regulatory deadline.
- Where GRC sits across multiple departments and activities in the organization individuals with those roles will coordinate their activities, possibly through a Compliance committee or similar mechanism.
- The organization invests significant time on stakeholder education, ensuring that the new ways of working together and the value of risk and adopting compliant processes are understood. However, commitment to upholding standards varies across the organization.
- Archivist Role Introduced—responsible for organizational storage governance, retention enforcement, and lifecycle management.
- Core processes and all sensitive data are clearly defined—Information owners take responsibility for defining and structuring their critical data.
- Formalized training for all users—Users are trained on metadata, labels, retention policies, and how misuse can impact security and compliance.

#### Process (300)

- ✨ There are staff with a role that includes monitoring regulatory updates and translating them into new company policies. In large organizations or those in industries with strong compliance needs, example roles may include Director of Compliance, General Counsel, Senior Information Risk Officer, Data Protection Officer). In smaller organizations it is likely to sit with members of the executive team or the functional head of departments with strong compliance alignment. This is seperate from or in addition to staff dedicated to security measures (for example a Chief Information Security Officer).
- ✨ Risk level is periodically reviewed & updated.
- ✨ Limited information and records are available for audit, these are generally specific to the function rather than providing an aggregated or holistic vie.
- There is limited or misplaced confidence that all governance and compliance risks are known and managed.
- ✨ There are systems, tools and processes for managing the Governance, Risk and Compliance processes. While these vary according to the standards and requirements imposed, they may include: training and knowledge content; risk, issue and status logs; asset and impact lists; action plans; processes for reviews and updates; systematic audits and assessments, staff training and competency logs.
- ✨ Strong content management tools and processes that include effective lifecycle management are in place.
- The organization measures and assesses controls and activity, but largely at an individual or devolved level.
- External sharing policies are defined and controlled—who can share what, with whom, and under what conditions.
- External users in Teams and SharePoint require approval before access is granted.
- Email attachments containing sensitive data trigger a review process before sending.
- Clear categorization of sensitive and critical business data, with guidelines on storage and protection.
- Ownership of content is clearly defined, with formalized processes for maintaining document integrity.
- Standardized site and document structures are implemented, reducing redundant storage and improving findability.
- A structured metadata framework is widely used, improving consistency across document management, but enforcement is not yet mandatory across all areas.

#### Technology (300)

- ✨ Technical controls to manage retention and deletion are in use and are generally effective for recognized classes of content (e.g. finance and HR files). A degree of automation supports this, reducing user burden and driving some level of consistency.
- There is a central (digital) system of record for compliance. However, usage varies across the organization and local solutions may be in use.
- Software solutions are used but typically in a tactical manner, without a thought for a broader set of requirements. This results in multiple systems to manage individual governance, risk and compliance initiatives, each operating in its own silo.
- Governance, risk and compliance controls are implemented but are reliant on the user to apply the right controls to the right content.
- Use of automated tagging, sensitivity labelling and policies is not broadly or well implemented, though it may be being piloted.
- Standardized Information Architecture Models—Adoption of consistent IA models and examples to ensure uniformity across sites and improve user experience.
- In-Place Records Management is introduced, ensuring documents remain in their original location while being classified as records.
- Enhanced Metadata Usage—Leveraging metadata over folders to facilitate easier filtering and searching of content.
- Formal metadata schema is applied to:
  - Identify personal data.
  - Define retention requirements—how long data should be stored.
  - Clarify the purpose of storage and regulatory requirements.
  - Apply disposition policies—deletion and archival timelines.
  - Defined Trigger Dates (when rules start to apply based on laws, regulations, or company policies) such as signing date, decision date, publish date, employee exit date, purchase date.
  - Retention policies are systematically applied to content types, ensuring compliance with governance requirements.
  

#### Impacts (300)

At this level:

- ✨ The organization starts to build a compliance culture with roles and responsibilities being defined.
- ✨ Employees start to understand the impact of non-compliance in their job roles.
- ✨ There are processes for dealing with finding, breaches and risks, however there are gaps and a tendency to be reactive.
- A Governance, Risk and Compliance framework, consisting of strategy, policies, processes, controls, technologies and staff competence, is implemented. However, implementation is uncoordinated and siloed.
- eDiscovery investigations are still complex and costly as multiple versions of data exist
- Not all Governance, Risk and Compliance risks are addressed and there are frequently unknown risks.
- Standardized site and document structures reduce redundant storage and improve findability.
- Clear categorization of sensitive and critical business data enhances data protection measures.


### Level 400 - Predictable

At level 400 maturity an organization’s approach to governance and compliance becomes more well defined and acts as a foundation for activity, the focus shifts from extensive written procedures to empowering individual employees to make informed decisions to reinforce the company’s compliance culture. This occurs as a by-product of establishing a culture with high compliance awareness.
The Compliance framework is now tailored to include an up-to-date and accurate catalog of information and data laws, regulations, and policies by country/region and is readily accessible to all relevant employees.
An overarching Governance, Risk, and Compliance process, through control, definition, enforcement, and monitoring, has the ability to coordinate and integrate these initiatives.

- Automated processes ensure consistent application of retention policies, reducing the risk of non-compliance.
- Ownership of content is fully established, with clear accountability for document governance.

### Level 500 - Optimizing

At level 500 maturity, an organization believes that taking a strategic approach to governance and compliance will actively support business goals as opposed to serving merely as a function of risk mitigation.

Metrics are reviewed regularly & updated as needed; results monitored & processes continuous improvement.

Compliance is embedded in the organization and business activities are ‘compliant by design’.

Organizations at this level use technology strategically to gain operational efficiencies, greater visibility into their operations, reduce risks, and drive down compliance costs. Tools are integrated in order to monitor controls and gain insights into their governance, risk and compliance program.
