## Overview of the Concepts [tl;dr]

Implementing new technology requires training people to use it, but that's just the beginning. With continuous changes happening across all IT systems, you need training not just at implementation, but ongoing maintenance and expansion of training as systems evolve. This is where continuous learning becomes essential—training isn't a one-time event, it's an ongoing process. When you involve end users early and train them properly, they understand why the solution helps them and the business. Structure your support team to work consultatively with the business through repeatable processes. This creates long-term collaboration and helps you focus on the most impactful solutions. A steering committee ensures a strategic approach that prioritizes requests across the business and aligns with company goals. This committee also shares success stories and knowledge to showcase returns on investment.

## Definition of this competency

The Staff and Training competency focuses on who will be sustaining the system and how they will engage the business and empower the end users to use the solutions. This includes not just initial implementation training, but ongoing training as systems evolve and change. The organization is focused on developing its people, processes, and therefore its capabilities through continuous learning and quality practices.

Note: In this article, we refer to IT as the primarily responsible department for the solutions. In your organization this might be a different group, so feel free to mentally substitute, as appropriate. Not all Microsoft 365 roll outs are IT-driven.

## Evolution of this competency

See the [Maturity Model for Microsoft 365 - Introduction](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md) for definitions of the Maturity Model levels.

### Level 100 - Initial

You might recognize this one. Organizations at the 100 level give more precedence to launching the solution than focusing on why the solution is launched. Typically there is a bottom-line problem to be solved (e.g. platform migration due to a merger) which takes top priority. User and training needs have not been defined, evaluated, or documented. This leaves end users to develop their own methods for working with the new solutions. As a result, they may miss out on core benefits of the solution. We often refer to this level as the "Wild West Adoption Model." (Yes, it's as chaotic as it sounds.)

**[Initial level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-100---initial)** characteristics include:

#### 100 User Experience

- System is launched without training or guidance.
- No information is available on who to reach out to for help or support with the system.
- ✨ **For productivity training, people use Google** to find solutions and learn how to use tools and get confused when finding outdated information, or blogposts about features that never made it to general availability or their tenant.

#### 100 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- Due to a lack of training or assistance, end users begin using the system as they interpret it should be used. This creates new change management challenges down the road—you'll need to unteach bad habits later. This is often a replication of old business processes in a new environment (for example, using SharePoint for file storage only). It works, but you're missing most of the value.
- The solution was launched without consultation with the business for needs or challenges they are facing so these new solutions are viewed as unnecessary or redundant to existing applications. It can actually seem as though work gets harder, not easier.
- Short and long-term system support was not considered so no formal business processes exist to support issues or requests. End users are left to problem solve with internet searches or by sending emails around the organization seeking assistance.
- ✨ **Every implementation and project requires a major effort** as they must reinvent the wheel to train employees, costing enormous amounts of money with much being wasted since there is no structure to build upon. Each project needs to create its own training strategy and have its own change managers. Training efforts become fragmented, and employees receive many different voices to listen to and always have something they forget to learn. Training lacks the company's tone and is highly dependent on individuals.
- For productivity training, employees resort to Google searches and self-directed learning, leading to inconsistent knowledge and potential security risks from following unofficial or outdated guidance.

### Level 200 - Managed

At this level, the focus is on improving the break/fix (tier 1) support by documenting processes and ensuring the support staff has repeatable solutions to common problems. There is a business process in place for reaching out to the support staff for help, though there is not a consistent resource for strategic guidance.

As the system grows in usage, some content owners have received one-off training. Training is focused on power users and has not been launched to the entire organization yet. Some departmental expertise begins to develop, and people start to know who the experts are. It's progress, but it's still a bit like herding cats.

**[Managed level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-200---managed)** characteristics include:

#### 200 User Experience

- Support and build mainly done by individual or small group.
- IT Help Desk is available for break/fix support only.

#### 200 Process

- Content owners from some functional areas are trained and using the system.
- ✨ **Informal champions programs may exist**, but they are voluntary and unstructured with no central place to discover which groups exist or how to join them. Many initiatives fade away when a key person leaves or becomes burned out. This is where you might want to start—finding those passionate people and giving them structure. Trust us, they'll thank you for it.
- Some meetings and training sessions are recorded, but they are rarely updated and content cannot be trusted. There may be one or multiple Learning Management Systems (LMS) as different departments have purchased training on their own initiative.
- A location on the intranet may exist with links to videos and other training materials, but there is no measurement or tracking of who takes which courses. Learning Pathways may exist but is not used much.

#### 200 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- The wait time for system support may be incredibly long due to limited support staff and limited knowledge. No support exists for a consultative approach to solve business problems, leaving end users to find their own solutions—often with competing products they don't realize you already have.
- Content owners may begin to share the message of positive impacts of the solution across the organization, raising interest, as they are empowered to work independently with the solution. This creates pockets of success but lacks organization-wide consistency.
- Informal champions programs may provide some value, but without structure or central discovery, many employees are unaware these groups exist. When key champions leave or burn out, initiatives fade away, wasting the knowledge and momentum that was built.
- Training materials exist but are scattered across multiple locations and systems, making it difficult for employees to find what they need. Without tracking or measurement, there's no visibility into training effectiveness or completion rates.

### Level 300 - Defined

This is where things start to click. The organization is actively using the solution(s) with a training plan in place for all new and existing employees. The training is focused on how to use the system—interacting with the interface and accomplishing basic tasks. This training helps raise the technical literacy of the organization as users begin consistently using the solution as intended. The established training also reduces silo solutioning with unsupported products, or misuse of the solution.

**[Defined level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-300---defined)** characteristics include:

#### 300 User Experience

- An IT resource is knowledgeable on the system and available for strategic guidance.
- End users have access to a centralized training platform and can find training materials through the Learning Management System (LMS).
- Training is available for all new and existing employees, though it may be focused on system interaction rather than business process transformation.

#### 300 Process

##### 300 Training Delivery

- An end-user training plan is in place.
- Onboarding and off-boarding is addressed in the training plans.
- Training is focused on interaction with specific systems.
- Roles and responsibilities for support and training are clear and funded.
- Basic awareness training may exist for AI capabilities embedded in Microsoft 365 applications, though comprehensive training on AI tools like Copilot may not yet be formalized.
- ✨ **HR takes responsibility for training centralization and management**: This is where it starts getting really good. Training is centralized with HR responsible for ensuring there is only one internal platform for training (multiple external platforms may exist depending on format and purpose). A Learning Management System (LMS) exists for tracking and delivering training. HR has responsibility for purchasing and coaching internally, but costs are allocated to the area owner (e.g., IT training costs to system owners, finance department owns time reporting training costs). HR supports purchasing and implementing standard training in the organization's LMS or external systems. This might seem like a small change, but it's huge—no more reinventing the wheel for every project.

##### 300 Competency Groups

- ✨ **HR takes responsibility for creating structured competency groups** for the competencies the business needs. HR implements rules and support structures to prevent burnout of passionate advocates (champions). Where passionate advocates exist, HR lifts the administrative burden and structures the group's meetings, content, requirements, and expectations. Where no passionate advocate exists or no one can drive the group, HR engages external speakers and drives the group. Competency groups are integrated into the organization's training strategy. Champions groups are more relaxed, focusing on people who are interested and want to learn more (almost nerdy—and that's a good thing). The minimum 4 hours per month commitment ensures participants don't hold the group back and constantly require starting from the beginning. Systems for competency groups exist, but there are only a few isolated groups at this level. See [Identifying Your Microsoft 365 Champions](/microsoft-365/community/identifying-your-sharepoint-champions) and [Empowering Your Microsoft 365 Champions](/microsoft-365/community/empowering-your-sharepoint-champions) for guidance.

#### 300 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- New hires use the system properly from the outset because they attend training focused on how to interact with the new system as it has become commonly used across the organization. This reduces onboarding time and prevents the need to "unlearn" incorrect usage patterns.
- As comfort with the system increases, end users are interested in increasing their usage of the system to solve other business problems. This creates a positive feedback loop where successful training leads to more engagement and further training requests.
- An IT resource is available to have these discussions, though it is not enough staff to support all needs—only high priority requests are taken into consideration. This can create frustration for departments with lower priority needs. (We've all been there.)
- Training centralization reduces duplication of effort and costs, though the transition from fragmented to centralized training may cause temporary disruption as departments adapt to new processes.
- Competency groups provide a structured way for passionate advocates to share knowledge, but with only a few isolated groups, the benefits are not yet organization-wide. Champions may feel isolated or unsupported if their group is one of the few that exists. Don't worry—this is normal at this level, and it gets better.

### Level 400 - Predictable

The training plan for Microsoft 365 is viewed as a suite of training courses that build off each other. The training is developed and led by individual business process owners who may sit outside the IT department. All training is linked in a central repository, like Learning Pathways or other Learning Management Systems, making it easy for end users to find all training related to Microsoft 365.

Now that the IT support staff has expanded, there are opportunities for the business to receive coaching, guidance, and innovation on their existing business processes in partnership with the IT department. The IT support staff proactively share updates and changes coming in the system to better involve business needs in their strategic decisions. This is where training becomes strategic, not just tactical.

**[Predictable level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-400---predictable)** characteristics include:

#### 400 User Experience

- End users have easy access to role-based training that is relevant to their job function and career development.
- Training is integrated into daily work with ongoing monthly training time allocated, making continuous learning a natural part of the work routine.
- Employees can track their training progress, certificate renewals, and competency development through the LMS.
- Support is available from multiple sources: IT support staff, competency groups, and HR coaching, providing comprehensive assistance for both technical and training needs.

#### 400 Process

##### 400 Training Delivery

- IT has more than one resource knowledgeable on the system.
- Requests for new functionality are tracked and prioritized.
- Communication strategy in place for sharing system changes and improvements.
- Training viewed as a program, not just string of individual system training.
- Positive outcomes are collected and measured to share with the organization and cross-pollination in training.
- Usage of the solutions becomes less IT-driven and more business encouraged due to clear benefit demonstration in ongoing training.
- Training programs begin to incorporate AI-powered tools and capabilities, with initial training on Microsoft 365 Copilot and embedded AI features. Training focuses on practical use cases and productivity improvements.
- ✨ **Training is role-based and competency-focused**: This is a game-changer. Training is tailored to specific roles in the organization (e.g., IT security training for employees, managers, system owners, and IT department, each with different content). HR assigns trainings based on what staff is hired to do, and role definitions are clear. Certificates that need renewal are tracked and managed. Some training requires tests and certification, while others may be "read a policy and 'I have read and understood'." Employees can enter external certificates, and there is internal competency mapping that can easily analyze competency gaps.
- ✨ **Ongoing training time is included for each employee on a monthly basis**, where they should take training, participate in competency networks, or similar activities. Weekly is best, but monthly is the minimum. Annual training is not sufficient—it's too long between sessions, and everyone needs to train continuously as IT changes occur continuously, sometimes daily. (Yes, we know it's a lot, but it's necessary.)

##### 400 HR Support & Governance

- ✨ **HR provides comprehensive training support**: HR works with reporting to managers whose employees fall below the approved level or have not met goals within deadlines, instead of nagging end users. HR supports the business with coaching to develop unique training that is needed. HR systematically works with system owners about their trainings and ensures they are updated and have the right quality. HR in their coaching ensures training is at the right level (e.g., when there is a new framework, the language doesn't need to come directly from lawyers' legal texts). Training should have the company's tone and maintain a graphic profile standard. HR has templates for different types of trainings. Trainings don't have to be well-produced, but they need to meet the need—sometimes just a recorded meeting will suffice (don't fall for the trap of making everything into a Netflix series). External content is linked and follows standards.

##### 400 Competency Groups

- ✨ **Competency groups exist for all core competencies the business needs**: HR continues to own the structure, rules, and support systems. Competency groups are designed for their target audience (e.g., Copilot may need two different groups: one for Copilot and productivity, and another for Copilot and development where AI is used to build AI into systems and processes). The **Digital leaders group exists for Microsoft 365**, driven by a change manager with strict governance, setting productivity standards and common rules. When new features are released, they are presented to this group, and if there is interest, the appropriate champions group is assigned to test and evaluate. **Power Platform competency groups are driven by an IT architect** who monitors when systems become critical to the business. A Center of Excellence for Power Platform exists with templates and governance structures to support these groups.

#### 400 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- Once training is viewed as a program, this allows for strategic planning on how to advance the technical literacy of the organization. The training is no longer focused on which buttons to click within a system and instead focuses on changes in behavior or business processes to work more efficiently. For example, a OneNote training would not focus solely on making sections and pages. The training would include productivity tips for how to use OneNote to increase efficiency in meeting note taking.
- As technical literacy increases, so does the interest from employees outside of IT. Content Owners are taking active roles working with their teams and the system to gather feedback, share with IT, and collaborate on solutions. Training attendees who are not content owners may begin to show a greater interest in the system and seek to be more involved. There still may be some challenges in leadership supporting time spent working with the system for non-IT roles.
- Now that the entire company is actively using the system for common business processes, there are regular updates shared with the entire company for changes and improvements on a regular cadence. There is a process in place to receive feedback from the organization which influences future enhancements and continuous improvement. The system support staff has increased enabling the business to shift support from reactionary to proactive and decreases wait times for help.
- Role-based training ensures employees receive relevant, targeted training that directly applies to their work, increasing engagement and retention of knowledge. Competency mapping allows the organization to identify skill gaps and address them proactively.
- Ongoing monthly training time creates a culture of continuous learning where staying current with technology is expected and supported. This prevents knowledge decay and ensures the organization can adapt quickly to new features and capabilities.
- HR's systematic work with system owners ensures training quality and relevance, while the pragmatic approach (recorded meetings vs. Netflix series) keeps training costs manageable and delivery timely.
- Competency groups for all core competencies provide organization-wide support networks, enabling knowledge sharing and peer learning at scale. The Digital leaders group creates consistency in how Microsoft 365 is used across the organization, while Power Platform groups ensure citizen development is properly governed.

### Level 500 - Optimizing

This is where you want to be. Business involvement in the Microsoft 365 platform has grown well outside of the IT department. Senior leadership is actively involved in proactively evaluating platform improvements and provides feedback on the strategic plan ensuring it aligns with company priorities. Senior leadership's involvement and support cascades down through the organization, which formally supports embedding platform roles and responsibilities into job descriptions of IT, content owners, citizen developers, and power users.

The most common support scripts and training content are developed with Chatbot and AI technology, allowing IT staff to focus on escalations, proactive initiatives, and reducing the amount of time spent on break/fix. Support ticket analytics are reviewed on a scheduled cadence to identify and prioritize closure of training gaps, minimizing employee downtime, and increasing organizational productivity. Microsoft 365 Copilot and other AI tools are integrated into training delivery, providing personalized learning experiences and on-demand assistance for end users.

**[Optimizing level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-500---optimizing)** characteristics include:

#### 500 User Experience

- Centers of Excellence or Communities of Practice exist around effective digital workplace implementations and transformation opportunities.
- Empowered user community (self-service governance in place).

#### 500 Process

##### 500 Training Delivery

- Dedicated system support includes strategic guidance, business analysis, training staff, and help desk support from IT. System support also includes members outside of IT, typically key stakeholders from other departments to inform strategy and road map.
- Training is integrated into the organization's learning strategy.
- ✨ **Comprehensive training programs exist for AI-powered tools** like Microsoft 365 Copilot, focusing on prompt engineering, responsible AI use, and maximizing productivity gains. Training includes understanding AI capabilities, limitations, and ethical considerations.
- ✨ **Certificate renewals are automatically scheduled** and courses are personalized with the help of AI for how employees learn new things. AI tools are used to create and maintain training content, adapt training materials to different learning styles, and provide personalized learning paths based on individual roles and needs. (Yes, the robots are helping you learn. It's actually pretty great.)

##### 500 Competency Groups

- ✨ **Competency groups are a natural part of the business** where everyone participates and solves the organization's problems and challenges. Groups are structurally assigned tasks to test new features and capabilities, serving as a think tank for innovation and continuous improvement.

#### 500 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- Clear business processes for system requests, feedback, break/fix help, and guidance build confidence across the organization that this system is useful and will have a long lifespan in the organization. This increased confidence leads to more transparent conversations around needs and employees are more willing to invest time to fully understand the system. Department leads and senior leadership understand the system is solving large business problems aligned with company goals and are willing to invest their time discussing the strategic road map.
- System changes and improvements are first discussed within Centers of Excellence or Communities of Practice which comprises of content owners, key stakeholders, and other system owners. These groups provide feedback on a continual basis and are often used for pilots before launching new solutions to the entire organization. Having these communities enables IT to complete better user research, align system changes with departmental-level goals, and receive more transparent feedback. If the business explores self-service options, empowering end users to manage their own solutions (with IT guidance) enables IT professionals to focus on a higher strategic level and reduces friction with end users.
- Training is viewed as an integral part of the learning road map and no longer only run by members of IT; training isn't just technical, it's transformational, often using "what if" scenarios. Content owners or Center of Excellence members offer training specific to tasks and business processes, replacing generic system-based training that was previously offered. Skill advancement is widely recognized and rewarded.
- Automated certificate renewal and AI-personalized learning paths ensure employees stay current with minimal administrative overhead. The system adapts to individual learning styles and preferences, making training more effective and engaging.
- Competency groups functioning as think tanks create a culture of innovation where testing new features and capabilities is a normal part of business operations. This enables the organization to quickly evaluate and adopt new technologies that provide competitive advantages.
- The integration of training into the organization's learning strategy means that skill development is recognized as a core business function, not an IT function. This elevates the importance of training and ensures it receives appropriate resources and executive support.

### Scenarios

Here's what this looks like in practice:

**Human Resources** content owner shifts recognition process to automated solution within system after seeing increased engagement with a Communication Site for their department. They realized that if people were already engaging with the site, they could streamline the recognition process right there.

**A cross-functional leadership team** discusses business process automation for action item tracking as the organization struggles with bandwidth challenges across departments. Training helps them understand what's possible and how to implement it effectively.

**Training is focused on productivity** and capturing institutional knowledge in repeatable ways to increase transparency across the business. This isn't just about learning buttons—it's about changing how work gets done.

**The IT team** measures system capabilities against other enterprise applications to provide business with clear guidance on what-to-use-when and where the system fits into the enterprise portfolio. This strategic approach helps everyone make better decisions.

### Cost & Benefit

Let's be honest: socializing the system and its benefits across the organization will take considerable time focused on education and change management. But here's where it gets interesting—when you structure it so that system and concept owners are responsible for training costs, but HR drives and manages the training, you create clear accountability. This structure makes it obvious which areas of the business aren't taking responsibility, and those areas will cost more. It's a powerful incentive for departments to invest properly in training.

At Level 400, the benefits really start to show. The business invests more in training, and as a result, the organization works faster and with higher quality. You can share resources like change managers and reuse programs and groups for multiple purposes. This creates economies of scale and reduces overall costs while improving outcomes. After the solution is implemented and staff is trained on how to use it, the time spent to complete tasks can be measured to show ROI for the process improvements.

Anecdotes are still very valuable. Some processes may not be possible to directly measure or might be new given expanded capabilities. New processes won't have the same opportunity to measure ROI, so anecdotes of added value are critical to showcase business enablement. Don't underestimate the power of a good story.

## Conclusion

Here's the bottom line: launching a system without full support or training risks a lost investment. But it doesn't stop there—with continuous changes happening across all IT systems, you need training not just at implementation, but ongoing maintenance and expansion of training as systems evolve. This is where continuous learning becomes essential. Employees will use the system incorrectly or miss features that could help them if training isn't maintained and updated. When planning, ensure there is time and adequate resources to engage the business early on in discussions around their needs and challenge areas. Focus your solutions on existing issues—that's where you'll get the most buy-in.

Providing solutions to existing problems will generate higher interest across the organization and justification for employees' time spent learning how to use them. Having a clear business process for feedback and transparency in the decision-making process will build trust with the organization. This supports the time and effort they are spending to understand the new systems. Developing these deep, trusted relationships with the business changes the focus of the conversations from specific technical requests to open dialogue around challenges or opportunities for innovation.

Remember: training isn't just about teaching people how to use a system once. It's about continuous learning—enabling them to work better, smarter, and more efficiently as systems evolve. Start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can. You've got this.
