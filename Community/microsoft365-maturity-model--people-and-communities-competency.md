## Overview of the Concepts [tl;dr]

The People and Communities competency is focused on ensuring people have the information they need, can discover valuable conversations, ask questions, knowledge share, and loop in experts. It also focuses on individual (and team) skills, profiles, and insights into colleagues to enable effective teamwork and collective activities. It encompasses communities of interest, organizational culture, and working within common values.

## Definition of this competency

For organizations to be effective they need to ensure that their staff can work together effectively both as teams and individual contributors. People need to be able to interact with each other effectively, understand skillsets, access expertise, and share interests with the right audiences.
This competency is different from the Communication competency, as it focuses on the interactions between people who are peers or at similar level in the organization, but who might not normally work together in the same department, business unit, or discipline.
Within Microsoft 365, this means multiple individuals communicating across different channels (or as Microsoft sometimes calls them “loops”) to target their messaging or requests to the right people, in the right place, at the right time.
The solution for which channels to use can vary depending on the size of your organization. For example, a small company of 6 might fulfill their need for company-wide communication via an org-wide Team while this approach would be disruptive to productivity in a company of 6,000 people actively using Teams to collaborate on projects.

## Evolution of this competency

See the [Maturity Model for Microsoft 365 - Introduction](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md) for definitions of the Maturity Model levels.

### Level 100 - Initial

You might recognize this one. Organizations at level 100 have done little to actively support people and communities, relying on organic and traditional approaches. They may still rely on outdated methods for finding people—like printed staff directories or Excel spreadsheets with contact information. (Yes, we know—it's 2026, but it happens. Though printed phone lists can actually be useful for IT incidents when systems are down.) There are no expectations within the company that personal profiles are completed or updated. Much of the important interaction between employees occurs in-person, in chat, or in hallways—often with no clear outcomes.

**[Initial level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-100---initial)** characteristics include:

#### 100 Culture

- At this maturity level, many end users don't know much about their colleagues and are unclear on how they should engage with them or reach out for help with projects and activities; this is also reflected in the amount of untargeted communications.
- Team building is based on personal knowledge and has little scope. Many staff feel left out or under-utilized for their skillsets. Expertise in different locations is rarely leveraged. Insights and support are often a matter of luck or chance.
- There is little reinforcement of organizational culture and vision.
- Limited internal communities inhibit supportive colleague relationships beyond immediate co-workers.
- Little has been done to actively support the concepts around people and communities, relying on organic and traditional approaches.
- Email distribution lists are the hub of community activity; the processes to update information belong to IT, are essentially manual, undocumented, and lack formal processes to manage their members.
- End users maybe lost and uncomfortable within the organisation.

#### 100 User Experience

- End users struggle to find colleagues and their expertise. They may resort to asking around, emailing multiple people, or using outdated directories.
- There is no reliable way to discover who has specific skills or knowledge. Finding the right person often requires luck or knowing someone who knows someone.
- Profile information is incomplete, inconsistent, or missing entirely. Users cannot trust the information they find, if they can find it at all.
- Communication happens primarily through email, with "reply all" being common despite the inbox clutter. There is no guidance on where to have different types of conversations.
- Communities of interest exist only in-person or through chance encounters. They are invisible to the organization and cannot be discovered digitally.

#### 100 Process

- There is, at best, basic profile data. This is inconsistent across different systems (e.g. Active Directory, Human Resources Information Systems, etc.).
- Staff profiles, accessible to colleagues, are absent or largely unmaintained; there is no expectation that profiles are completed and updated. Any that do exist are likely to be limited to identifying who works in the organization and in which department (with contact information). Hard copy staff directories or Excel spreadsheets may be in use.
- ✨ **HR has no responsibility or processes** for ensuring accurate profile information in Microsoft 365. There is no ownership or accountability for profile data quality.
- Organization charts are created manually, inconsistently published, and frequently out of date. They may also be shared via email to department members.
- Because staff have no access to a reliable directory and may not know the best communication mechanisms to use, colleagues are often overlooked or uninformed. Long-term staff are frequently interrupted with requests for their knowledge, even when others might have been able to assist.
- People use “reply all” despite the impact this has in colleagues’ inboxes. Employees are unable to easily identify who-does-what in the organization, find subject matter experts, or understand the reporting structure. Requests for expertise and questions are often asked via email and then forwarded around the company until the correct subject matter expert is identified; minimal shared insights are created.
- There is no company guidance on where to have different types of conversations, share interests, or seek advice and engagement from colleagues.
- No process exists for discovering whether colleagues have particular skills, areas of expertise, or common interests and values. Communities of interest are serendipitous and do not take place digitally. They are effectively invisible to the organization.
- Personal contact, telephone, and email are the primary means of communication.

#### 100 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- There is little company guidance on where to have different types of conversations. This leads to most people feeling that, while much information is coming at them, little is what they need to know or actionable.
- No processes or tools exist to discover whether colleagues have specific skills, areas of expertise, or common interests and values. In project-based environments, it's difficult to find out who worked on past projects.
- Communities of interest are serendipitous and do not take place digitally. Most conversations use email as the only communication channel.
- Staff retention may be difficult as there is little in the way of glue to keep people together and create those connections. Users may feel lost and unsure of their purpose. This impact will be harder if the organisation is largely working remotely.
- Systems may exist to support identifying who works in the organization and in which department. Distribution lists are used to communicate with groups such as "All Company" and each department. The processes to update information fall to IT, are essentially manual and undocumented, and lack formal processes to manage their members.

### Level 200 - Managed

At this level, the focus tends to be on creating communication channels for the inner loop. This represents groups of people working together on projects—the organization's usual units of work. Each team may decide how to communicate internally, but there is no enterprise-level guidance on which solution to use based on the project goal. There may be pilots for capturing outer loop conversations (corporate communications, CEO town halls, employee interest groups) in another communication channel. It's progress, but it's still a bit like herding cats.

**[Managed level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-200---managed)** characteristics include:

#### 200 Culture

- The focus tends to be on creating communication within known groups of people working on projects (the inner loop).
- Community spaces may be piloted, though these are likely to be somewhat ad hoc with little management, oversight, or intended purpose.
- Use is encouraged in some teams, but not enforced.
- People are able to form better connections with one another.

#### 200 User Experience

- End users can sometimes find people and skills across the organization, but it's neither efficient nor reliable. Multiple directories may exist, but they're inconsistent and not standardized.
- Profile technology is available and can capture skills, but the quality and completion varies widely. Users may find some profiles helpful while others are empty or outdated.
- Some teams have started using community spaces, but these are ad hoc and may not be discoverable. Users may not know these spaces exist or how to join them.
- Self-service groups may be available, but there's no consistent guidance on when to use them. Each team decides based on their own preferences.
- Finding the right person or expertise still requires significant effort, and users may still resort to emailing multiple people or asking around.

#### 200 Process

- There are likely to be multiple directories, often managed at the department or project level. These may be effective and maintained in some instances, but there is little aggregation, standardization or control. Some of these may draw on definitive sources, such as Active Directory, but without consistency. Centralized directories and people cards may be piloted but have not replaced local versions.
- Staff profile technology is available, which can capture skills and other information, not just contact details.
- Terminology is not standardized; quality and completion is variable.
- It is possible to find people and skills across the organization, but this is neither efficient nor assured.
- Self-service distribution lists (Microsoft 365 Groups) may begin to be leveraged.
- Policies and guidance on aspects of People and Communities exist, but this is not tracked, lacks metrics and is not strongly advocated for within the management process. Each team may decide how to act on the guidance based on the project goal and their team preference.
- The information in the Staff profiles is manually entered by the IT department.
- ✨ Profile information in Microsoft 365 is updated ad hoc if someone cares enough to do it. There is no systematic process or responsibility for ensuring profile accuracy.

#### 200 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- Staff productivity is reduced due to the time spent trying to engage the right people in activities, source knowledge and expertise. The attempts to provide technology to support people, groups, and the company culture are compromised by poor data quality, inconsistent approaches, and a lack of commitment at all levels. Staff and management are equally frustrated by this but lack outlets for addressing the issue. (We've all been there.)
- Avoidable mistakes are made due to the right people not being engaged.
- Project and other teams are slow to form.
- Employees may begin to see the value in separating communication into different channels where the communities are more focused on specific tasks and topics. Email communication diminishes as inner loop and outer loop conversations move to different and more targeted solutions. The way different communities communicate still varies widely by functional area.
- Staff retention levels are increased over level 100 as people feel more connected with one another and the organisation. Don't worry—this is normal at this level, and it gets better.

### Level 300 - Defined

This is where things start to click. Commonality across teams starts to drive where communities are created. Microsoft Teams or Viva Engage Communities are created based on the type of work people are doing rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Team communication channels are well defined and agreed upon as a standard business process.

**[Defined level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-300---defined)** characteristics include:

#### 300 Culture

- Commonality across teams starts to drive where communities are created and set up. Microsoft Teams or Viva Engage Communities are created based on the type of work people are doing rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.
- Team communication channels are well defined and agreed upon as a standard business process.
- Community spaces connect a targeted set of users. The purpose and etiquette of community spaces is defined.
- End users share their knowledge and expertise within the communities and this fosters a culture of support and stronger connections.

#### 300 User Experience

- End users can easily find colleagues and their expertise through profiles and search. Profile information is more complete and accurate because HR owns the responsibility for data quality.
- Communities are discoverable and have clear purposes, making it easy to know where to post questions or share information. Users understand the difference between Teams for project work and Viva Engage for company-wide communication.
- HR processes ensure profile information is updated when employees join, change roles, or leave. Users can trust the profile data they find, and there are clear processes for reporting errors.
- The Communications department ensures there are living communities for questions, answers, and company buzz. Users know where to go for information instead of relying on mass emails.
- Managers are coached to communicate via Viva Engage, including a leadership corner. All managers, not just extroverted ones, are supported in sharing information effectively.
- Users can update their own profile information (name, phone number, etc.) through self-service mechanisms, making it easy to keep personal details current.

#### 300 Process

##### 300 Profile Management

- People profiles have additional information populated for skills, expertise, and past projects which can maintained by each individual.
- Processes exist to create and populate staff profiles in appropriate systems in response to trigger events (new starter, role change, leaver). Compliance with maintaining profiles is a matter for line management.
- Staff have the ability to update elements of their profile and request updates to other attributes.
- Custom profile fields support subject matter expertise identification and other attributes important to the organization.
- Photos are updated from a central source.
- Profile information is sometimes used as a data source and integrated within systems and processes. It becomes possible to automate organization charts; attempts are made to resolve the inconsistencies this reveals.
- ✨ **HR is responsible for ensuring accurate information in Microsoft 365 profiles.** Recommendations exist for how people should fill in their profiles so others can find them and their competencies. HR owns the responsibility for profile accuracy and establishes processes and guidelines for profile management.
- ✨ **Triggers exist for profile updates** including new starter, role change, department transfer, and leaver events. When employees move within the organization, HR is responsible for updating their profile information. Simple self-service mechanisms exist for employees to update their own name, phone number, and other personal information.
- ✨ Standard helpdesk tickets exist for when an employee sees incorrect information in a profile, and when a manager sees incorrect information. This creates a systematic way to report and correct profile errors.
- Organizations may have different Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems. If HR has a personnel system, it is the master for personnel data and should automate synchronization to Microsoft 365. This ensures profile data remains accurate and consistent across systems.

##### 300 Communities & Groups

- Processes may not be systemically or repeatedly used to the extent needed for their users to become fully competent in which community they should share information forming gaps in adoption and consistency.
- Local directories are in the process of being eliminated.
- Staff know how to identify groups, distribution lists and other groupings for communication and engagement.
- ✨ **The Communications department is responsible for Viva Engage**, concepts for different groups, and ensuring these are integrated into the channel strategy. Communications is responsible for ensuring that mass emails are not needed to inform all employees—they ensure there are living communities and have a group for all questions and answers and 'buzz' on the intranet. When information is shared via email with newsletters and email distributions, information is locked away and new employees will never access the old discussions that have created the organization's culture. Communications is also responsible for ensuring managers inform via Viva Engage, including a leadership corner. Communications should coach managers—ALL managers should inform, not just those who are extroverted. Communications should not control or filter, they should support and coach managers. Crisis communication also needs to exist in Viva Engage when something major happens.

##### 300 Expertise Discovery

- People begin using search to identify subject matter experts in the organization instead of emailing multiple people across the organization because they can find better results with people profiles.

#### 300 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- End users begin to see the ROI for completing their profiles as they can more easily identify who-does-what across the organization. Working teams and employee interest groups experience an increase in engagement and productivity as they connect in communication channels specific to their goals.
- In order to solve problems in daily work, employees frequently reach across organizational boundaries based on content ownership, and subject matter expertise they recognize as useful. This creates a positive feedback loop where successful connections lead to more collaboration.
- Staff retention levels increase as the sense of purpose and belonging is stronger between the users, organisation and one another. People feel like they are valued and this helps them stay connected and continue to support their colleagues.

### Level 400 - Predictable

**[Predictable level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-400---predictable)** characteristics include:

#### 400 Culture

- A strategic view of all communication channels including email, Viva Engage Communities, Teams (backed by Microsoft 365 Groups), distribution lists, and security groups increases engagement in the respective communities. These opportunities lead to serendipitous connections between people who might not have previously collaborated.
- Communities flourish under governance.
- Communities and their members are easily discoverable through search. End users begin following the groups and communities which match their interests, even if not directly aligned with their work.

#### 400 User Experience

- Profile information is highly accurate because it's reviewed as part of evaluation processes. Both managers and employees are responsible for keeping profiles up to date, and after the first year, data quality reaches nearly 100% accuracy.
- Users can easily discover and join communities through templates and systems. All communities are listed on the intranet, making it simple to find groups that match interests, roles, or locations.
- Intranet content directs users to communities instead of email addresses. Users know to post questions in the appropriate community where champions and experts provide answers that benefit everyone.
- Dynamic groups based on profile attributes (like "London office" or "budget owners") automatically include the right people. Communications can target messages surgically to the right audience, and these groups can also be used for SharePoint audiences and automatic access.
- AI tools suggest relevant communities and groups users should join based on their role, interests, and collaboration patterns. This helps users discover opportunities they might not have found otherwise.
- Users can manage their own community memberships through self-service, reducing reliance on IT for group management. Dynamic distribution lists replace manually maintained ones, ensuring groups stay current automatically.

#### 400 Process

##### 400 Profile Management

- Profile fields may integrate with Line of Business data.
- Dynamic organization charts are available based on up-to-date data about each employee.
- Staff photos are updated across multiple systems and profiles from definitive, managed source. Photography style is defined.
- ✨ **Profile accuracy is included in evaluation processes** where both manager and employee are responsible together for reviewing and updating profile information. When profiles are systematically reviewed, data quality increases. After the first year of this practice, profile data quality reaches nearly 100% accuracy and is maintained at this level because profile review is now embedded in processes and checklists where appropriate.

##### 400 Communities & Networks

- Staff are encouraged to ask questions within the communities and answer the questions.
- ✨ **Templates and systems exist for communities** of various natures (e.g., social groups, competency groups, leadership corner, geographical groups, role groups or other activities that create community). Communities can exist in either Viva Engage or Teams, depending on functional needs. Templates are available and all communities are listed on the intranet.
- ✨ **HR owns the rules and systems** for displaying all networks and how to join them. Networks can exist as long as there is interest, but the rules for creating them are owned by HR. Network leaders have community leadership included in their role development and measurability.
- ✨ **Intranet content no longer directs users to "send email to a person"** for questions or feedback. Instead, users are directed to the appropriate community where questions can be asked, feedback given, and answers provided. This creates transparency, and champions within the communities provide responses, making knowledge sharing visible and accessible to all.
- ✨ **Communications builds the channels** and HR owns many that are dynamic groups based on attributes or similar in the profile, such as "London office", "Seasonal workers", "budget owners". Communications targets messages surgically to the right target group and can also use these groups as target groups in SharePoint. These groups can also be used to automatically grant access to roles.

##### 400 Communication Channels

- There is an increased focus on self-service for end users to apply solutions and technologies to their work so they can manage their own membership.
- Manually maintained distribution lists are uncommon having been replaced by dynamic distribution lists and groups, based upon employee characteristics for all company communication, Microsoft 365 Groups for teamwork conversations, and Viva Engage for company-wide and cultural communication.

##### 400 Expertise Discovery

- Tooling will indirectly establish who the subject matter experts are based on the authors of content.
- ✨ AI tools help users find the right places to be and participate by analyzing their role, interests, and collaboration patterns, suggesting relevant communities and groups they should join.

#### 400 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- Users rely on different communication channels to stay informed for their day-to-day work as well as for special interest areas that contribute to company culture. They understand and follow governance best practices to share knowledge in these separate channels, with a high degree of trust in the platform getting their message to the right people.
- Communication in separate communities is fluid and largely frictionless, allowing easy access to inner loops and outer loops, when useful. Organization charts are no longer manually created as end users use the dynamic organization chart in people cards to identify company structure.
- Staff retention levels are further increased as the feeling of belonging, purpose and value increases. Connections and friendships occur across office and team boundaries.

### Level 500 - Optimizing

This is where you want to be. People are connected across the organization based on their skills, interests, and work. Innovative collaborations arise without formal structures. Communities and conversations extend to external participants when it makes a process more effective. Employees are finding opportunities to innovate within the company spurred by new connections.

**[Optimizing level](microsoft365-maturity-model--intro.md#level-500---optimizing)** characteristics include:

#### 500 Culture

- People are connected across the organization based on their skills, interests, and work.
- Innovative collaborations arise without formal structures.
- Communities and conversations extend to external participants when it makes a process more effective.
- Employees are finding opportunities to innovate within the company spurred by new connections.

#### 500 User Experience

- Profile management is fully automated with recruitment flows and organizational changes. Users don't need to worry about keeping profiles updated—it happens automatically as part of HR processes.
- AI tools proactively suggest relevant communities, groups, and conversations based on role, interests, collaboration patterns, and organizational connections. Users are guided to the right places to participate and contribute.
- Everyone participates in the core competencies they need for their work role. Internal mentorship structures are in place, with seniors serving as mentors and juniors participating to improve in their development areas.
- Viva Insights helps users understand how they're spending their time and with whom, empowering them to maintain stronger connections across the organization.
- Users can use people cards to find more than just organization structure—they can see common documents and connections that spur further collaboration.
- Profile data can be maintained by users and writes back to Active Directory or HR systems, ensuring a single source of truth that flows both ways.

#### 500 Process

##### 500 Profile Management

- End users use people cards to find more than just organization structure and expand the usage to seeing common documents to spur further collaboration.
- Users can maintain important profile data that writes back to Active Directory or Human Resources Information Systems.
- ✨ **Profile management is implemented and automated** with recruitment flows, reassignments, and other HR processes. Profile updates happen automatically as part of organizational changes, ensuring profile data remains accurate and current without manual intervention.

##### 500 Expertise Discovery

- ✨ AI tools help users find the right places to be and participate by analyzing their role, interests, collaboration patterns, and organizational connections, suggesting relevant communities, groups, and conversations they should engage with.

##### 500 Mentorship & Development

- Viva Insights / MyAnalytics helps inform end users on how they are spending their time working with different people and empowering them to keep stronger connections across the organization.
- ✨ **Everyone participates in the core competencies they need for their work role**, with internal mentorship structures in place. Seniors serve as mentors and share knowledge, while juniors participate to improve in their development areas. This creates a culture where knowledge sharing and development are embedded in daily work.

#### 500 Impacts

At this level you can expect the following:

- Business leaders and platform administrators implement continuous improvements based on user activities and feedback. Users are proud of the communities they have built and can show real ROI for increased engagement over the way they previously communicated.
- Senior leadership is actively engaged across the organization, walking the walk and talking the talk. This creates a culture where people and communities are valued and supported at all levels.

### Scenarios

Here's what this looks like in practice:

**An employee interest group** is forming and needs a place to share how to get involved. At Level 300+, they can create a community in Viva Engage or Teams with clear purpose and governance, making it easy for others to discover and join.

**An employee needs to share a personnel change** with the rest of the organization. Instead of sending an email to "All Company" (which clutters inboxes), they post in the appropriate community where it's visible, searchable, and doesn't interrupt people's workflow.

**A project team** has been setup to investigate a new product and needs a place to work together, plan, and manage the project. At Level 300+, they create a Team with clear communication channels and governance, enabling effective collaboration.

**A new employee** reaches out to the organization for help understanding a technology the company uses. Instead of emailing around, they post in the appropriate community where champions and experts can provide answers that benefit everyone.

**A manager wants to recognize** an employee or team for their hard work. They post in the appropriate community where recognition is visible, searchable, and contributes to company culture.

**A marketing person** is looking for success stories from the organization. They can search communities and profiles to find subject matter experts and success stories, making it easy to gather content for campaigns.

### Cost & Benefit

Let's be honest: this requires investment. Communications and HR need to step up and hire people to manage this and coach others. They need to create training materials and coach managers and experts to communicate effectively with these tools. This is an investment, but the returns are significant.

The speed and accuracy of messaging will increase, and this is the root cause of many incidents and problems. When people get the right information at the right time, mistakes are avoided, decisions are better, and work gets done faster. Faster onboarding of new hires means they become productive sooner. When people feel seen and connected, they stay longer. Personnel retention is very expensive—recruiting, hiring, and training replacements costs significantly more than keeping good people. This competency helps you keep people longer.

Transparency and not having knowledge locked up in email creates 24/7 searchability. Information can be found by AI to achieve higher speed in resolving issues and completing work tasks. When knowledge is in communities instead of email threads, it's accessible to everyone, searchable, and contributes to organizational learning. New employees can access historical discussions that have shaped the organization's culture, not just current information.

Some examples of ROI include:

- Reduced incidents and problems due to faster, more accurate messaging
- Faster onboarding as new hires can access historical knowledge and find connections
- Improved staff retention as people feel seen, connected, and valued
- 24/7 searchability of knowledge that was previously locked in email
- Faster issue resolution and task completion through AI-assisted knowledge discovery
- Better decision-making as the right people get the right information at the right time

## Conclusion

Here's the bottom line: improving your People and Communities maturity means rethinking your processes and decentralizing communication from one channel to multiple areas. This isn't just about technology—it's about creating connections, enabling knowledge sharing, and building a culture where people can find each other and work together effectively. Embracing different levels of persistence and types of interaction with communication in these channels supports end users' ability to be more focused and deeply engaged in conversation, achieving better results. Empowering your end users to manage their own communities enables IT professionals to focus on a higher strategic level and reduce friction with end users.

These improvements have a huge benefit to staff well-being and retention levels which is often a hidden benefit. When people feel connected, valued, and can find expertise when they need it, they're more likely to stay and contribute.

Remember: this isn't just about profiles and communities. It's about enabling people to work better together, find expertise when they need it, and build connections that drive innovation. Start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can. You've got this.
